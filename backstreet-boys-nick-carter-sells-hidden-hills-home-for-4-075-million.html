Records show the couple bought the knoll-top property two years ago for $3.65 million before pouring an undisclosed amount into several remodeling efforts. Although the Carters initially brought the home to market for $4.25 million, they settled just under the original price tag and sold the 1.25-acre estate to Bachelor director Ken Fuchs for $4.075 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-220294 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/k.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-220294 class=wp-caption-text>Keller Williams Realty</p><p>Situated within a peaceful gated community and accessed by a private drive, the two-story Paradise Valley Road home is a fusion of 1950s traditional-style architecture and modern amenities. The 5,200-square-foot home neighbors the estate's outdoor swimming pool and spa, a brand new guesthouse, and a customized chicken coop that mirrors the style of the main house. In total, there are five bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms spread out across the property.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-220297 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Keller-williams-2.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-220297 class=wp-caption-text>Keller Williams Realty</p><p>The main level of the home features an open-plan layout, including a sizable great room, den/office space, and a family/entertainment room with an aquarium. Both the chef's kitchen and the home's bathrooms are adorned in flashy Calcutta marble counter tops. Highlights of the primary residence include beamed ceilings, neutral and subdued hues and fixtures, and updated wide-plank hardwood floors. Meanwhile, the home's oversize master suite boasts a fireplace, two walk-in closets, steam shower, and a private balcony overlooking the backyard.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-220296 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Keller-williams-5.jpg alt width=900 height=506 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-220296 class=wp-caption-text>Keller Williams Realty</p><p>Sliding glass doors on the home's first floor open into a covered patio with a peaceful view of the green, hilly landscape. Stone steps create a path past the guesthouse and to a spacious pool and spa area flanked by large rocks, trees, and shrubs. Not far from the pool area is the chicken coop built to resemble the main house. From the yard, there are two unique views: the sight of city lights and the serenity of rolling hills.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-220293 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-630312450.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-220293 class=wp-caption-text>Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images for iHeart</p><p>Singer-songwriter Nick Carter, 37, holds a net worth of <a href=#>$35 million</a>.
