In the manga and anime, the character proves to be a terrible challenge for Luffy and his allies, serving as the titular antagonist during the Arlong Park Arc.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Equipped with one of the most iconic noses in all of anime history, Arlong is immediately one of those anime characters that makes you think: “There’s no way they can make this character live-action.” Well, Netflix did it – Arlong has officially jumped into the live-action adaptation realm! In Netflix’s One Piece, the character appears in four episodes and is portrayed by American actor McKinley Belcher III.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-mckinley-belcher-iii data-injectable=false>Who is McKinley Belcher III?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/McKinley-Belcher-III.jpg><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>McKinley Belcher III is a veteran performer. In 2010, he appeared in his first television role, playing a part in an episode of Law & Order: LA. The next several years saw him take on roles in many other police procedurals, with the actor making guest spots in Rizzoli & Isles, Elementary, and Chicago P.D.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>One of Belcher’s biggest roles arrived in 2017, when he began portraying FBI Agent Trevor Evans on Netflix’s hit series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ozark</a>. And this year, the actor would get another big break on a Netflix series, this time in a world far away from the police procedural setting.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=false>Belcher has taken sail on the high seas as every fan’s favorite super-strong, money-loving, water-throwing pirate. Bringing a character like Arlong to life in live-action wasn’t the easiest task, but Belcher did it, and the actor made sure the character didn’t lose his savage edge during the transition. And somehow, he makes that nose work, that takes skill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasaNirrO4zqeeZqGeYrumwMWloLGrXaS7pnnPopycnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-sam-collins-dating-sam-collins-s-girlfriend-exes.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Sam Collins Dating Sam Collins's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
