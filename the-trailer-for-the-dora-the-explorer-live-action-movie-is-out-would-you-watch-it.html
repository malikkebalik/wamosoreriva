She stars as Dora in the live-action film of Dora and the Los City of Gold, based on the cartoon, Dora the Explorer. We didn’t watch a lot of Dora when my kids were young but we watched it occasionally so I am familiar with it. The cartoon took Dora on a variety of scavenger hunts through the jungle with her trusty sidekick, Boots the monkey, a seemingly bottomless backpack and a map. Not just any map, but a map that felt compelled to announce his arrival through a theme song that consisted on one line, “I’m the map” that repeated over and over and is such an earworm that I just got stuck in my head as I wrote this -argh! Stupid Map! Anyway, the first trailer dropped so let’s give this a whirl, shall we?</p><p></p><p>If you haven’t heard me say it before: every movie should cast Michael Peña. I find him delightful. It’s looks like he and Eva Longoria are well matched in this. I’ll be honest, the plot is much more complex than I would have guessed for a Dora the Explorer film. I didn’t expect all the layers like sending Dora to regular school because the jungle is too dangerous, only to redeposit her back in the jungle but now she has to look after some “regular: kids. It also looks like there are some cute winks and nudges like the fact the parents disappear, because you spend a lot of time wondering where the hell they are during the cartoon. That and someone finally questioning the safety of this young lady walking around with machetes and pickaxes. I am interested in what they will do with Diego. He’s kind of her mentor in the cartoon right? Dora’s nemesis is a red fox named Swiper who keeps trying to steal things she needs to complete her adventures. He’s not in the trailer but he’s voiced by Benicio del Toro in this, that should be amusing. I had zero interest in a live action Dora movie before this trailer, but I’m in now. It comes out August 12th.</p><p>I swear to God, if they try to sneak that damn map song in there, you’ll hear my wails from the West Coast.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wenn20593597-683x1024.jpg alt=wenn20593597 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Michael Peña with his Narcos co-star, Diego Luna, who is not in Dora but should be because yum<br><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wenn35603889.jpg alt=wenn35603889 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wenn35651100-682x1024.jpg alt=wenn35651100 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Danny Trejo voices Boots<br><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wenn36019528-682x1024.jpg alt=wenn36019528 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: WNN Photos and YouTube</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmb2lkbYR2e9OhnJisopa2rbHRmJ2oqo%2Bptaarw6ipmpeknbKgsdepo6iqlaesrbXVnpaam6SevK%2BrzKitop2PnsCgu9StlrCnpaGxoMXOrpawmaSYtaC102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shark-tank-who-are-mr-wonderful-s-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Shark Tank: Who Are Mr. Wonderfuls Kids?</span></a>
