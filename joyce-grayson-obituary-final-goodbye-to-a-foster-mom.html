Have a look at the below post related to her death:</p><p>Grayson’s cause of death is unknown and an autopsy has not yet been conducted.

She entered Windham Tech’s nursing program after graduating from Killingly High School, where she obtained her licensure as a practical nurse.</p><p>She worked as a mental health nurse for the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services for twenty-six years, first at the Southeastern Mental Health Authority in Norwich, the Capitol Region Mental Health Center in Hartford and Norwich State Hospital, a former psychiatric hospital.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Joyce-Grayson.jpg><p><strong>She started working as a visiting nurse for Elara, formerly known as New England Home Care, after retiring from the state.</strong> She enjoyed baking and cooking when she wasn’t working and she frequently donated to neighborhood bake sales.</p><p>She loved to go camping and the beach in the summer and to take quick excursions to Florida with her family and friends in the winter. <strong>She also spent around 20 years, from 2002 to 2021, loving and caring for 35 children as a foster parent for the state Department of Children and Families.</strong></p><p>In 2017, the organization presented her and her spouse, Ronald, with the Foster Parent of the Year award.
