He is a Major League Baseball player for the Atlanta Braves and also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs previously. Joc played an important role to take Braves into the World Series final and every time proved why he is one of the best MLB players at the moment as well.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Joc Pederson was born in Palo Alto, California, on April 21, 1992. Joc Russell Pederson is his full name. Stu Pederson is his father’s name, and Shelley Pederson is his mother’s name. His father is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played for the Major League Baseball’s Los Angeles Dodgers. Champ and Tyger Pederson are his two brothers, while Jacey Pederson is his sister. Tyger, Joc’s older brother, played baseball for the University of the Pacific before joining the Dodgers minor league system and playing second base. Champ, Joc’s eldest brother, has Down’s syndrome and stays with him during the season on occasion. Jacey, his younger sister, is a professional soccer player in the United States. Palo Alto High School was where Pederson went to school. Pederson earned his bachelor’s degree in 2010.</p><h3>Joc Pederson Career</h3><p>He chose to sign with the Dodgers rather than play for USC after the 2010 MLB Draft. He started his career with the Ogden Raptors, a Dodgers farm team, where he was selected a Rookie League, Pioneer League, and Baseball America Rookie All-Star. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Pederson in the eleventh round of the 2010 MLB draught. On September 1, 2014, he made his Major League Baseball debut as a substitute player against the Washington Nationals at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The next year, he proved to be a perpetual holder, hitting his first grand slam against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 12. In May, it set a new record for a debutante by winning nine grand slams in a single month. He became the first Dodgers minor leaguer to be called up for the All-Star Game since Hideo Nomo in 1995.</p><p>His season ended with a.210 batting average, 26 home runs, and 54 home runs. Pederson set a World Series record with his fifth back-to-back race with an additional base batting in race 6 of the 2017 World Series, his third in the configuration. The Dodgers were eventually defeated by the Houston Astros in four games. The 2019 season was the best for him in his entire career so far where he hit 36 home runs and also participated in the second Home Run Derby. The very next year, he recorded .190 bat but improved it with four hits in 10 in the world series. Due to this performance, Dodgers won the championship and currently, he is leading the charge for Atlanta Braves against Houston Astros.</p><h4>Social Media</h4><p>On social media, Pederson is active. He has 1,719 Instagram posts and 660K Instagram followers. Joc primarily discusses his game on his social media accounts. He doesn’t appear to be active on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Joc Pederson Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Joc Russell Pederson</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>21 April 1992</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>29 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Palo Alto, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball Outfielder</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Joc-Pederson-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 1” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 186 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 99 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 220 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>11 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Honey Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Stu Pederson</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Shelley Pederson</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Jacey Pederson</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Champ Pederson,&nbsp;Tyger Pederson</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Palo Alto High School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Joc-Pederson-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td>Kelsey Williams</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Two (Poppy Jett Pederson)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Kelsey Williams is his wife’s name.
