For Branch, it’s mostly about his ego.</p><p>Creek, like Poppy, was also a foil to his character. In Trolls: The Beat Goes On!, Branch shows tough mistrust towards him when he reappears in the village, refusing to trust him at all. Though they come to a mutual understanding, the two don’t get along and often compete with each other.</p><p>Both remain fairly headstrong in desperate situations, though Branch is more prone to being over cautious or paranoid making him more likely to react in the face of danger. In Trolls World Tour, Branch has become a close friend of Poppy and is now a former recluse, happily taking part in their singing and dancing and having fun together.</p><p>Branch is Poppy ‘s boyfriend, and the male protagonist of the DreamWorks Trolls franchise. He’s a member of The Snack Pack, having joined the group since the events of Trolls and acting as its second-in-command after Poppy.</p><h2>What does Poppy confess about his troll gem?</h2><p>These are skills Branch has to slowly work on. When Poppy has to confess what happened to his Troll Gem in “Gem Day” as his friends offer theirs in place of his lost Gem, stating “You’re the last Troll that should go without a gem, Branch”. Branch has had to really work much harder then other Trolls to get where he is.</p><p>Branch befriends Baha after the pair end up getting eaten by Finn Cascade, a giant fish who was visiting Troll Village. He attempted to get a photo with the fish, only for him to get swallowed.</p><p>He’s sound throughout the series’ merchandising, and is often the second-most commonly merchandised Troll after Poppy due to her status as<strong> the franchise’s main protagonist.</strong></p><p>In Critter Comfort, he is seen playing a<strong> banjo.</strong> In Trolls World Tour, Branch displayed the ability to match the dancing skills of The K-Pop Gang, as well as the ones of Tresillo, Marimba and Tambora; this was despite the fact that their dancing skills should have been foreign to him as a Pop Troll.</p><p>When he was temporarily transformed into a Rock Zombie, Branch expressed<strong> a zealous support for Rock music.</strong> As part of a joke, he suggested they all get ripping tattoos everywhere on their bodies, except their faces in case they still needed office jobs. He also showed a vicious aggression when he used his rocking mullet to ensnare Poppy at Barb’s command. Otherwise, he stood there with an empty look.</p><p>As a child, Branch has<strong> short indigo</strong> hair. He’s seen wearing light brown shorts with a strap around his right shoulder and a few green patches, which is quite similar to the shorts he wears when he gets older. He also wore a blue hug-time bracelet.</p><p>Branch is<strong> Poppy ‘s boyfriend, and the male protagonist of</strong> the DreamWorks Trolls franchise.
