He is very funny and I find him handsome too – he has a nice smile and kind eyes. I didn’t really care about his body – this is actually the first time I even considered the fact that he HAS a body. But Kumail wants us to know about his body. He’s pulling a Chris Pratt – or something? – and suddenly going to the gym constantly and trying to get beefy and cut. He’s 41 years old! I don’t know, I go to the gym a lot too but I’ve never tried to build 20 pounds of muscle out of nowhere, which is what Kumail is trying to do. He spoke about <a href=#>his gym journey to Men’s Health</a>, and he makes it sound like he’s actually doing it to be considered for more acting jobs. Some highlights from the piece:</p><p><strong>On making a transformation from comedic actor into action star:</strong> “I realize what’s holding me back from those roles is how I look. So I’m changing that.”</p><p><strong>On becoming addicted to exercise:</strong> “When I’m exercising, I’m not thinking about anything else. It’s like meditation.” That may be why Nanjiani’s friends “practically staged an intervention” a few months ago to get him out of the gym. The last thing they want is a T-1000 clone of Nanjiani replacing Silicon Valley’s Dinesh. “Effort isn’t funny,” he says. “Several of my friends have said, ‘There’s nothing funny about a guy who works out all the time.’” Nanjiani doesn’t care. “I’m kind of obsessed with it.”</p><p><strong>On expanding his acting range:</strong> “Look at Bruce Willis in Die Hard. He was very funny while staying true to the tone of the movie. If I can be a big, buff person with the same outlook I have now, that would be pretty cool. There aren’t many people around like that.</p><p><strong>On his go-to cheat meal:</strong> “Pakistani food is delicious, but it’s a lot of carbs: biryani, naan bread, tons of rice. Afterward, my wife and I will say, ‘Let’s take a quick nap.’We wake up five hours later.”</p><p><strong>On his current diet:</strong> “Basically, it’s five days of low-carb, then over the weekend you eat as much as you want. But I’m trying to figure out the food thing right now because I wasn’t eating enough. I’m still kind of afraid of gaining the wrong kind of weight, because I’m very vain.”</p><p><strong>On his facial hair:</strong> “I grew a beard because I needed a crutch to start working out intensely. But it’s going well now, so I’m going to shave it.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Men’s Health]</a></p><p>You actually can get addicted to exercise, because of the release of endorphins. Endorphins are like your body’s natural morphine – they give you that satisfied, tired-but-happy feeling at the end of your workout. And people get addicted to that feeling, and so they work out more, and then if they stop working out, they have a “come down” because their body isn’t producing those endorphins. I don’t hate that Kumail is trying to change it up and redefine who he is as an actor, but… yeah, I just don’t think he’s suddenly going to get hired for all of the action-hero roles. But I’m sure he enjoys his workouts.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kumail1.jpg alt=HLH070119_022 width=580 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Hana Asano for Men’s Health magazine, sent from promotional Men’s Health email.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmb2pnZoJze8qupJqhnJS7orrJopinoY%2BewKC3yKebmKeWlLyjv8Ssqp6cj6y2tbS%2BsKaro5mjtKC71K2WpqGXncGgrsSYmKeXla2ys6%2FIrJyYmZSZtqTAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-shameless-star-cameron-monaghan-and-model-lauren-searle-s-new-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Inside 'Shameless' Star Cameron Monaghan and Model Lauren Searle's New Relationship</span></a>
