Regardless of what the context was, it’s an honor to be heard in the same airspace as Nirvana.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-way-the-world-reacted-to-nirvana-s-smells-like-teen-spirit-and-boston-s-more-than-a-feeling>The way the world reacted to Nirvana’s ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ and Boston’s ‘More Than a Feeling’</h2><p id=par-7_65>“More Than a Feeling” and “Smells Like Teen Spirit” both became hits; however, one song charted higher in the United States. “More Than a Feeling” hit No. 5 on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard Hot 100</a>, staying on the chart for 19 weeks. The song appeared on Boston’s self-titled debut album. Boston peaked at No. 3 on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard 200</a> and stayed on the chart for 138 weeks.</p><p id=par-8_78>Meanwhile, “Smells Like Teen Spirit” reached No. 6 on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard Hot 100</a> and remained on the chart for 20 weeks. “Smells Like Teen Spirit” appeared on <a href=#>Nevermind</a>, Nirvana’s most successful album. The album topped the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard 200</a> for two weeks and spent a total of 558 weeks on the chart. Cobain said “Smells Like Teen Spirit” contained a cliche riff but that didn’t stop it from becoming one of the most famous rock songs of the 1990s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvsL%2FTqKWsZaSkum6%2FwqGmpbJdmLyuucSnq56cXai2rrXLmqmirKliu6q%2B1ZqlmqtdqLqmuMusZKWhm5p6tbHEp2SsqJmntrV5zKipnmWkna6vecBmnZ6dnJ67qHrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-charlie-hunnam-s-girlfriend-morgana-mcnelis-do-for-a-living.html><span>←</span><span>What Does Charlie Hunnam's Girlfriend Morgana McNelis Do For a Living?</span></a>
