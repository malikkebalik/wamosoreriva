You might have also heard that the buyer of the piece was one Robert Mnuchin, father of United States Secretary of the Treasury,&nbsp;<a href=#>Steven Mnuchin</a>. But a point of clarification might be necessary: Mnuchin is an art dealer, and he carried out the purchase on behalf of billionaire art collector <a href=#>Steve Cohen</a>.</p><p>Mnuchin's professional career began pretty far from the art world, at Goldman Sachs, where he got a job in 1957. He stayed on at the company for 33 years, eventually joining the firm's management in 1980. Ten years later, he retired, but in 1992, he broke into the art brokering business at C & M Arts, a gallery he formed, along with established art dealer&nbsp;James Corcoran. Since then, the gallery has seen its name change to&nbsp;L&M Arts when another dealer,&nbsp;Dominique Lévy, joined in the business.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-282236 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1127311160-1.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-282236 class=wp-caption-text>Leon Neal/Getty Images</p><p>But, as we mentioned earlier, the actual owner of&nbsp;Rabbit&nbsp;got it through Mnuchin, acting as a broker on his behalf. And that owner, hedge fund manager&nbsp;Steven A. Cohen himself has plenty of experience in the art world, having amassed an <a href=#>incredible collection of art valued at at least $1 billion</a> (and that was before his most recent acquisition!).</p><p>Cohen's art collection includes works by such famous artists as <a href=# title="Andy Warhol Net Worth">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href=# title="Pablo Picasso Net Worth">Pablo Picasso</a>, and many more. And&nbsp;Rabbit&nbsp;is not even the first work by Jeff Koons to become part of that collection – he reportedly already owns one of the artist's famous&nbsp;Balloon Dog&nbsp;pieces, in yellow. How much he paid to acquire that sculpture hasn't been publicly stated but for comparison's sake, another version of&nbsp;Balloon Dog&nbsp;(this one in orange) sold for the princely sum of&nbsp;$58 million in 2013.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfqMGmwsSnZKampZi1qrrSZp2arJiav26%2Bzpucq6xdmbalec2oq2aipajBbr%2FPnqWdZWlmeq61y6WgqKZdpLturYyjnJ%2BeXaC8sLrSZqqcrZylwba%2BxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./private-university-presidents-who-are-making-huge-salaries.html><span>←</span><span>Private University Presidents Who Are Making HUGE Salaries</span></a>
