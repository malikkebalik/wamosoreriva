Then they’re going through my lingerie [and] they read my diary. They’re just, like, ‘Oh, we’re cute.’ And then the girls even defend them. It was just really weird.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maitland Ward thought ‘it was just [her] job’ to act out ‘problematic’ storylines</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_25>Ward is not pleased with these <a href=#>Boy Meets World plots</a> today.

If I knew what was going on,” the actor shared. “[But] I was just told to do these things.”</p><p id=par-9_70>“It was more fun in the first year because even the sexual [story lines] that I did with the guys in the apartment [were about how] they were falling all over themselves to impress me,” Ward went on. “But that last year was weird. … I became too annoying to myself. I didn’t like [what Rachel became]. My character really had nothing to do except be b****y, snarky or sexy.”</p><p id=par-10_28>Summing up <a href=#>her time on the show</a>, Ward said, “[Those storylines were] so problematic. But at the time, I thought it was just my job to do it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maitland Ward’s successful adult film career</h2><p id=par-11_17>After Boy Meets World ended, she continued acting, appearing in movies like Dish Dogs and <a href=#>White Chicks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_23>In 2019, Ward began appearing in pornographic films.
