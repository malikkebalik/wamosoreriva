Harris managed just 122 of his 386 passing yards after a tough hit from FSU's blitzing cornerback <a href=#>Greg Reid</a> with 11:45 left to play, which left his right arm numb until the next drive.</p><p>The ninth game brought a change for the BCS 17th-ranked Hurricanes, as a 24-17 halftime lead against the Virginia Cavaliers broke into a dominant second half. Miami outscored Virginia 28-0 to defeat the Cavaliers 52-17. Harris went 18-of-31 with 232 yards, two touchdown passes, and one interception. The previously-struggling Miami defense was not to blame for the allowed points, however, as two special teams miscues leading to two blocked punts brought 14 points to Virginia. The tide-turning play: a 66-yard punt-return by sophomore WR Thearon Collier that brought seven points for the Hurricanes.</p><p>Harris was 17-of-34 passing for 224 yards with a touchdown pass and another score off a 13-yard run in Miami's 28-13 road win on October 16 over Duke. A week later Miami fell behind 10-7 in the 2nd quarter at home against the North Carolina Tarheels. Harris directed the 'Canes to 23 unanswered points as he completed 21-of-32 passes for 217 yards and three touchdowns in the contest, winning 30-10.</p><p>On October 8, the Hurricanes came up short against 17th-ranked Virginia Tech, 38-35. Harris was 13-for-21 passing the ball for 267 yards with three touchdowns, including a 77-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver <a href=#>Travis Benjamin</a> against the Hokies.</p><p>Harris signed with the Montreal Alouettes (CFL) on February 14, 2017. During the 2017 preseason Harris completed 15 of 23 pass attempts for 163 yards.</p><p>On July 13, 2014, Harris signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In the 2015 season he appeared in three games for the Ti-Cats completing 13 of 23 pass attempts for 160 yards. Following the season he was not re-signed by the Tiger-Cats and became a free-agent.</p><p>Following his time in the United States Harris came north to Canada and joined the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL) on February 6, 2013. After spending the 2013 season on the practice roster Harris was released by the club on June 15, 2014.</p><p>Harris was not drafted in the 2012 NFL Draft. After the draft, he received an invitation to the Miami Dolphins' training camp. He signed with the Philadelphia Eagles on May 11, 2012, but was waived on May 21.</p><p>On August 25, 2011, Harris was ruled ineligible to play the first game of the 2011 season for his involvement with the <a href=#>Nevin Shapiro</a> scandal. Quarterback <a href=#>Stephen Morris</a> started, losing to Maryland on September 5, 2011. Harris then returned after the suspension and threw two touchdown passes along with two interceptions in a 24-6 win against Ohio State.</p><p>Harris threw for 271 yards on September 24, 2011 against the nationally ranked No. 15 Kansas St. Wildcats in a losing effort, 28-24, as he completed 21-of-31 passes for two touchdowns. Harris was stopped short of the goal line on a quarterback sneak as the game clock expired.</p><p>In a 28-21 loss to Virginia (the Cavaliers finished 8-5 in 2011), Harris went 21-of-30 for a season best 311 passing yards and three touchdowns, including one of those going for 51 yards to wide receiver <a href=#>Tommy Streeter</a> in the third quarter. He also rushed six times for 22 yards in this October 27 matchup with the Cavaliers. Miami came up short in a November 12 loss to ACC rival Florida St., 23-19. Harris went 20-for-31 passing the ball for 225 yards with one touchdown. Harris also rushed six times for 31 yards against the 23rd-ranked Seminoles.</p><p>As a junior, Harris started the first eight games of the year before a concussion sidelined him for three games, forcing true freshman <a href=#>Stephen Morris</a> to pick up the slack. The Miami Hurricanes finished with a record of 7-6 as their head coach, <a href=#>Randy Shannon</a>, was fired near the season's end on November 27, 2010.</p><p>Harris came to University of Miami to compete for the starting quarterback position with former Mr. Florida award winner <a href=#>Robert Marve</a>. Harris and Marve split time as starters, with Marve starting 11 of 13 games. Marve subsequently transferred out of Miami, leaving Harris the full-time starter heading into the 2009 season. During the 2008 season, Harris led Miami on two comeback drives against Duke and Virginia. Harris finished the season with 1,195 yards, 12 touchdowns, and seven interceptions as the Hurricanes wound up 7-6.</p><p>In a July 31, 2009, interview with <a href=#>Dan Le Batard</a>, Harris told the world that he will pick up his Heisman Trophy wearing a pink suit and with a "pimp cup" in hand. He also earned himself a new nickname in this interview: Afro Butterfly.</p><p>In the second game of the 2009 season versus the Yellow Jackets at home, Harris completed 20-of-25 passes for 270 yards and three touchdowns—and the 20th-ranked Hurricanes snapped a four-game losing streak against #14 Georgia Tech with a 33-17 victory on September 17, 2009.</p><p>Harris attended Miami Northwestern High School, located in Liberty City, Miami, Florida. He became the starting quarterback for the Northwestern Bulls football team as a junior in 2006. That year, he would lead Northwestern to an undefeated season and its third state championship while completing 275-of-425 passes for 3,542 yards, 35 touchdowns, and six interceptions. As a senior in 2007, under his leadership, the team went on to another undefeated season and state title, as well as the high school football national championship. During his senior year, he completed 222-of-333 attempts (67% completion rate) for 3,445 yards, with 49 touchdowns and only six interceptions. In total, Harris finished with a 30-0 record as a starting quarterback in high school. Harris was awarded a Class 6A first team all-state selection, the Mr. Football Award (Florida), and Class 6A Player of the Year. Harris attended the 2007 Elite 11 football camp and was ranked as the seventh best pocket-passer quarterback in the nation.</p><p>Jacory Sherrod Harris (born May 12, 1990) is a Canadian football quarterback for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Harris started for Miami Northwestern High School during his last two years; he was unbeaten (30-0) and led the team to two state championships. In his senior year, Harris broke the state record for passing touchdowns and won the 2007 High School Football National Championship. He was named Florida's Mr. Football. During his freshman year of college in 2008 with the Miami Hurricanes, he split time with <a href=#>Robert Marve</a> in a two-quarterback system. After the Emerald Bowl in late December, Marve transferred to Purdue, effectively making Harris the undisputed starter for the rest of his career as a Hurricane. He signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in May 2012.</p><p>In an ACC matchup against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, Harris went 22-for-44, 330 yards passing, three touchdowns, and one pick. On a key 4th-and-16 on the Hurricanes final game-winning drive, Harris found Aldarius Johnson on a finger-tip catch which kept the drive alive. Harris sealed the 28-27 victory for "The U" off a 13-yard touchdown pass to <a href=#>Travis Benjamin</a>. The Hurricanes moved up to #16 in the polls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn66ku9GyZKGZoqe2tA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fran%C3%A7ois-berl%C3%A9and-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Franois Berland Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
