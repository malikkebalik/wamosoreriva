It’s been, what? Eight years of this. That was when Eddie and LeAnn’s affair began, and that was when – let’s just say it – LeAnn became obsessed with Brandi. LeAnn wanted what Brandi had and has. LeAnn wanted Eddie. LeAnn wanted Brandi’s clothes. LeAnn wanted Brandi’s children. LeAnn wanted Brandi’s life. Brandi said earlier this week that Eddie is only staying with LeAnn until he can cash out in a divorce. But now Brandi is saying that LeAnn and Eddie are still joined together in making her life miserable. And she gets very specific about how LeAnn has single-white-femaled her this whole time.</p><p>Brandi Glanville claims LeAnn has been “copying her life” and using her employees to “harass” her online.</p><p>She said: ‘Over the past few recent years I have really made an effort to take the higher road with Eddie and LeAnn for the sake of my boys in an attempt to have a more positive co-parenting situation. I honestly do prefer peace. During these years I’ve dealt with her obsession with me in the form of her copying my life from going to my dentist, dermatologist, plastic surgeon to even attempting to see my trainer of 14 years. I let all of this go in hopes that it would soon come to an end.’</p><p>‘However, just recently I was invited to attend a party for a magazine and just three hours prior to the event was called and told that Leann & Eddie asked that I be uninvited or they would not attend. Honestly, who does that? We are all adults here. I’ve had to deal with harassment online by her employees for years and these are people she pays- her music producer, hairstylist, and former road manager to be specific. I did not react to these recent things I tried to turn a blind eye.’</p><p>The My Kitchen Rules star claims she reached a “breaking point” last month when LeAnn allegedly “hurt and tormented” her by using her two sons “as pawns”.</p><p>She continued in a lengthy statement first obtained by TheDirty.com: ‘My last straw was a couple of weeks ago when her and her assistant watched my boyfriend’s Snapchats several times over the course of a few hours and just happened to show up where we said we would be to celebrate step-Mother’s Day (a day early). They sat across the room from us just to hurt and torment me by using my own children as pawns. I’ve done my best to keep quiet over all of her antics but bringing my boys into this was my breaking point. I just want the truth out there and for all of her nonsense to stop. As with any mother, all I wish is for my boys to have the peaceful family life they deserve. I am in a great place with both love and work and I’d like to be left to live it out without this nonsense.’</p><p><a href=#>[From The Daily Mail]</a></p><p>The kind of behavior that LeAnn has engaged in for eight years is really gross. I believe Brandi. I believe Brandi because we’ve been able to see it with our own eyes over the years, the million different ways she’s copied and stalked and harassed Brandi. And I believe it’s still happening too. And it’s pathetic.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wenn31040498.jpg alt="LeAnn Rimes Performing at Manchester Bridgewater Hall" width=540 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbmtoa4Bze8GrmKecmZS0ra3Nr6ClpJWUsabAwKKjrJeYpMSguMSapaeXop66pr%2B%2BmqOlnZeasa3FvqyrmqSbmrGgtMCrmKyrlZmsqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephanie-mcmahon-wiki-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography-net-worth-more.html><span>←</span><span>Stephanie McMahon Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</span></a>
