In 2016, she began hosting the dating show Chinese Dating, where parents decide on a prospective wife for their sons. The show has come under criticism for portraying a conservative view on marriage and the role of women in the family. She can speak Chinese, English, Korean, Italian and French.</p><p>In 2013, she began her ascent to national fame while serving as a judge on China's first season of So You Think You Can Dance. Jin went viral when she scathingly commented on the show's host's attempt to turn a contestant's injury into a sob story. She commented, "Chinese TV always digs at people's scars, consumes their pain. This is the biggest weakness of Chinese TV and I hate it! I hope that on 'So You Think You Can Dance' we won't use people's pain, we won't use people's sympathy, we won't use people's suffering." Audiences ate up her raw honesty and nine months later she had her own nationally broadcast show.</p><p>Jin's dancing works are "startlingly original and provocative." These include The Imperial Concubine Has Been Drunk for Ages (Guifei zui jiu, an adaptation of the famous Peking opera title) and Cross Border–Crossing the Line (Cong dong dao xi, a collaboration with British pianist Joanna MacGregor).</p><p>Her film debut was in the Korean movie Resurrection of the Little Match Girl in 2002.

She underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1995 in Beijing.</p><p>During her time in America, she, at the time legally male, married an American woman in 1990 in a bid to obtain a Green Card. They divorced in 2000. She married her German husband Heinz Gerd Oidtmann in 2005. Since 2000, she has adopted 3 children from orphanages in China. In 2016 Xing and Oidtmann divorced, allegedly because as a legal couple, their children could not obtain Hukou due to the One-child policy; they still live together and remain intimate.</p><p>In 1987, Jin went to New York to study modern dance for four years, studying under modern dance pioneers such as Limon, Cunningham, and Graham. She then traveled and performed in Europe, and taught dance in Rome from 1991 to 1993, followed by a world tour, and returned to China at the age of 26. She underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1995. Her left leg was paralyzed for a while after the surgery. In 2000, she moved from Beijing to Shanghai and opened her dance troupe. At the age of 33, Jin adopted a son and then two other children she raised by herself until her marriage in 2005. She currently lives with her three adopted children and German husband in Shanghai.</p><p>Born to ethnic Korean parents, Jin studied in a local Korean elementary school. Her father worked in the police department. She was praised as highly intelligent, and had won abacus contests many times. She expressed high enthusiasm in dance performance. At the age of 9, she joined the People's Liberation Army to receive dance and military training from a dance company affiliated with the Shenyang Military district.
