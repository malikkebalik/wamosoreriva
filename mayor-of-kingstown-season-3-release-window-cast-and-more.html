Given this significant hurdle for the series, one of many currently happening in the world of TV production, here is what has been confirmed about the following season.</p><h2 id=h-mayor-of-kingstown-season-3-release-window data-injectable=false>‘Mayor of Kingstown’ season 3 release window</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mayor-of-kingstown-three.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>As stated, Jeremy Renner’s significant injuries from being run over by a snowplow earlier this year will likely affect the filming of season three significantly. Renner, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered blunt chest trauma and over 30 broken bones in the accident</a>, will likely continue his sabbatical from acting for the foreseeable future.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Additionally, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) strikes have been ongoing since July 2023, with no end in sight as of September 2023. This means that regardless of injury recovery, Renner, alongside his co-stars, cannot participate in any on-screen acting, which means the series will not be filmed any time soon.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>This week, the Writers’ Guild of America (WGA) ended their five-month-long strike action, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">agreeing to a new deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers</a> (AMPTP). Given all this time away from the writers’ room, the writing side of the Mayor of Kingstown is probably still in its infancy, if it was even started before the strike began. It will be some time before the series will have all the episodes written and re-drafted in accordance with the new rules for writers under the new deal.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>‘Mayor of Kingstown’ season 3 cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mayor-of-kingstown-mike.png><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>With season three so early into its production and with the writing segment of its development yet to be completed, no major casting changes have been made to the Mayor of Kingstown.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Jeremy Renner, a keen supporter of his show – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even while in hospital</a> – will most likely return for the new season.
