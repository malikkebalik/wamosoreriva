Her character was first introduced during Chicago Fire Season 1 Episode 1, which aired October 10 of that year. She was a paramedic on Ambulance 61. Dawson and Casey used to be married, but they are no longer together. The former couple divorced after she moved to Puerto Rico. Before getting involved with Casey, Dawson dated a few men on the show, including Jay Halstead and Peter Mills. Dawson and Peter broke up after it became clear she had feelings for Casey.</p><p id=par-4_57>Dawson is no longer part of the firehouse, but her presence is still felt. She was recently heard from after she called Casey to ask about Mouch’s award. This initially caused problems between Casey and Sylvie Brett (Kara Killmer). Brett was initially hesitant to move forward with Casey because she believed he wasn’t completely over his ex-wife.</p><p id=par-5_60>When Dawson called Casey at the firehouse, Brett thought this confirmed her worst fears. It turns out, she had nothing to be worried about. Casey later told her during the <a href=#>Chicago Fire Season 9 finale</a> that after speaking to Dawson one more time, he realized what he really wanted. His desire is to be with Brett because he loves her.</p><h2 id=h-monica-raymund-s-net-worth>Monica Raymund’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/monica_raymond.jpg><p id=par-6_18>As of this writing, Raymund has an estimated net worth of $4 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 id=h-monica-raymund-s-movies-and-tv-shows>Monica Raymund’s movies and TV shows</h2><p id=par-7_76>One of Raymund’s early acting roles was in the 2007 short film Fighter, in which she played the role of Sarah.

According to her, their romance is pretty much done.
