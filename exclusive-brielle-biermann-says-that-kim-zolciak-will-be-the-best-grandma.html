Like, I want a little baby. And if you don’t have it, I’m going to have one.’”</p><p>Evidently, The Real Housewives of Atlanta star would have also been fine with a pregnancy from her younger daughter <a href=#><strong>Ariana Biermann</strong></a>.</p><p>Brielle described, “She’s like, ‘Ariana come on. Like, one of y’all have a baby. I’ll take care of it.’ I’m like, ‘You’re insane. I’m not having kids.’”</p><p>Although children were not in her plans, the influencer was clear that it would be “the happiest day” of her mother’s life if she were to get pregnant.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“Oh my God, she would love it. She would lose her mind,” the Don’t Be Tardy star detailed. “[She] would be so excited that there was a baby coming around.”</p><p>Brielle explained that her mother loves babies and always has baby fever, but she knows that she wouldn’t want to deal with another child in the house.</p><p>“I always used to say [to my mom] growing up, ‘I want you to raise my kids because you did such a good job,’” she recalled. The model also praised her mother and father at the time for having a house where she could “share everything you could think of with them.”</p><p>It’s unclear if Brielle’s feelings towards her adopted dad have changed since Kim’s messy split from <a href=#><strong>Kroy Biermann</strong></a>, but she has confirmed that she looks forward to having her mom’s help raising a baby.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmnrCTocK0tdWeZJuqmZq5rbGMm6Ceqp2Wu6950pqwrGWkna61ecqipGayn6Gwqq3KZq6ipJxir6Z506GcZpqVqMFus9GapZ2lkWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-moore-cuts-price-on-75-million-nyc-penthouse.html><span>←</span><span>Demi Moore Cuts Price On $75 Million NYC Penthouse</span></a>
