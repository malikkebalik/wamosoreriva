The R-rated film follows two characters named Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) during their senior year of high school.</p><p id=par-4_45>Mintz-Plasse plays their classmate Fogell who gets a fake ID during the movie with the name “McLovin.” Superbad was Mintz-Plasse’s first movie, and he was chosen for the role because he was able to have unbridled confidence while also playing a high school nerd.</p><p id=par-5_27>“You could tell he was a kid who had probably seen the inside of a locker,” casting director Allison Jones told <a href=#>The New Yorker</a> in 2015.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-the-actor-s-mom-was-present-on-the-superbad-set>The actor’s mom was present on the ‘Superbad’ set</h2><p id=par-6_37>Not only was Superbad his first movie, but Mintz-Plasse was also only 17 years old when he played Fogell. A couple of years after the movie premiered, Mintz-Plasse sat down for an interview with <a href=#>The Guardian</a>.</p><p id=par-7_20>In the interview, Mintz-Plasse revealed that his mom was on set when he filmed a sex scene for Superbad, saying:</p><p>“My first ever sex scene in a movie was in Superbad. Because I was 17, for legal reasons my mother had to be on the set. It was real awkward but it worked out OK because when I watched the movie with her the sex scene wasn’t awkward because she’d been right there when it happened. Afterwards we didn’t talk about it; we still don’t speak about that moment. Now, I’m 19 so my mom doesn’t have to be in the room when I have sex, thank God.”</p><h2 id=h-jonah-hill-did-not-like-christopher-mintz-plasse-at-first>Jonah Hill did not like Christopher Mintz-Plasse at first</h2><p id=par-8_43>In Superbad, Fogell and Seth repeatedly clash due to their friendship with Evan. Seth finds himself jealous of Fogell because Fogell and Evan plan to room together at college. This rivalry partially continued offscreen as Hill did not enjoy working with Mintz-Plasse.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_37>“Chris just immediately shut me down,” Hill told <a href=#>The Ringer</a>. “So combative. I was really annoyed because this guy wouldn’t let me say anything. And I told Seth and Evan that and they were like, ‘He’s perfect.'”</p><p id=par-10_55>Rogen agreed, saying, “Jonah f*cking&nbsp;hated&nbsp;him… He was all over Jonah’s lines, completely disrespectful of the process, probably due to a lack of experience. I remember he walked out of the room and Jonah was like, ‘Not&nbsp;that&nbsp;guy.’ And we were just like, ‘Oh my god, you don’t understand how much more that makes us want him.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtrzEq5manF2YtbO10q2mqaCVp3qutc2tsWaonJbAtLHSZqSopV2srrWvx56bZqCZonqntcumZKGho2LApsSMrJqeppVjtbW5y2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./3-year-old-unwrapped-family-s-christmas-gifts-at-3-a-m.html><span>←</span><span>3-Year-Old Unwrapped Family's Christmas Gifts at 3 a.m.</span></a>
