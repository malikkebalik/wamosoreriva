Here’s what happened.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>First of all, I saw the film on a Tuesday after its opening weekend (bargain night). For that reason, it could very well be that my theater and others have mostly corrected whatever issues were going on. For the most part, I didn’t experience any glaring issues, gratefully, although there were arguably some character-specific exceptions.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Going into Spider-Verse, I was even informed by my own brother that when he saw the film over the weekend he also couldn’t hear certain parts of the dialogue that imparted certain plot points and so he felt lost in the movie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>I saw the film at a different theater, on a different day, in a different state, so by no means is this a scientific account. But for my part, I could easily hear the introductory monologue by Hailee Steinfeld’s Gwen Stacy, for instance. This specific intro scene was called out to illustrate the “widespread problem” of the audio issues. Per <a href=#>Collider</a>, people could not hear her monologue underneath her drumming. For me, that was not a problem, I heard that part perfectly fine. However, there were some minor issues here and there with certain characters.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>On Friday, Spider-Verse producer Phil Lord acknowledged that he heard of people not being able to hear certain bits of dialogue. In a Twitter post, Lord said the issue likely stemmed from projectionists not playing the film at the intended volume for the mix.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Lord apparently also made stickers for the projectionists with a friendly reminder to turn up the volume to 7 or even 7.5.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-character-specific-audio-issues data-injectable=false>Character-specific audio issues</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#SpiderVerse</a> friends! if you get to the theater early and you want a fun mission ask someone to check that the theater volume is set at reference (7)! If it sounds a bit quiet, invite them to turn it up a touch to 7.5! If they give you flack… tell them we said it was okay. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BfgKuK9uM2</a></p>— Phil Lord (@philiplord) <a href=#>June 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>In terms of not being able to understand the dialogue, or it sounding incomprehensible, I will say I could not keep up with everything Daniel Kaluuya’s Spider-Punk was saying in the movie. However, the character speaks with a thick cockney accent and uses the relevant slang, so maybe it is solely due a lack of familiarity that I couldn’t understand it. However, it also sounded rather mumbly.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Another complaint I’ve heard people say is that the characters’ mouth movements don’t always match up with the dialogue being spoken. I thought I almost saw this happen, from time to time, with Oscar Isaac’s Miguel O’Hara. However, if the dialogue was out of sync, it was very subtle. It could be that Miguel only looked out of sync, however, due to scenes cutting to him when he is in the middle of dialogue, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>In neither case did these issues hinder my enjoyment of Spider-Verse one bit. In fact, I tend to believe that when it comes to Spider-Punk and Miguel, any audio idiosyncrasies could simply be artistic choices on the part of the filmmakers. Maybe Spider-Punk only speaking in a mumbly cockney accent only adds to his anarchistic nature. Maybe Miguel’s lip movements not looking match-perfect with the dialogue is some kind of metaphor for him having different values and motivations from Shameik Moore’s Miles Morales.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=711 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>I think back to the first film, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and remember how I only found out later that Miles’ frame rate was slower than that of Jake Johnson’s Peter B. Parker. A novice observer could have chalked this up to be some kind of mistake on the part of the filmmakers, but it was actually intentional. Slower frame rates in cartoons are considered to be a bit simpler, signifying Miles’ lack of experience in comparison to his mentor. Subtle manipulations such as this would not be out of line for the follow-up film, so I’ve taken my experience as being one the filmmakers intended for me to see. By the way, I saw the film at a Cinemark theater in Oregon, so take that as you will.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>However, the entire experience of trying to hear the same audio issues that others have mentioned, and seeing how Lord addressed it on Twitter, has led me to believe this was a genuine issue for many. Luckily, and perhaps because I saw the movie after its opening weekend already came and went, I did not share this experience. So clearly, it’s not a universal problem.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=false>It’s unclear whether the audio problems have been largely stamped out at theaters or whether I was just lucky. But regardless, the viewing experience for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was wildly entertaining for me, overall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2LAsbXDnqlmpZGjeqKv0aiqrGWknbJuv8%2Bim56qXauys7%2FEZp%2BarpVirrawyKhkoqujqrK0eceeqZ6rXay1osCMomShnZGnsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christopher-mitchum-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Mitchum Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
