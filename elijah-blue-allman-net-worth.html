As we detail in the next section, Elijah is the beneficiary of a trust set up by his late father. That trust distributes significant funds on a regular basis. Elijah Blue Allman is the son of <a href=#>Cher</a> and her second husband <a href=#>Gregg Allman</a>, founding member of The Allman Brothers Band.</p><p>Elijah Blue Allman serves as the lead vocalist, lyricist, and guitarist of the industrial metal band Deadsy, which he co-founded in 1995. He has also been featured on various songs by other artists over the years, including songs by the bands Orgy, Coal Chamber, and Thirty Seconds to Mars.</p><h2 id=cher-conservatorship><strong>Cher Conservatorship</strong></h2><p>In December 2023, Cher reportedly filed to request a conservatorship over Elijah. In her filing Cher claimed Elijah was "substantially unable to manage his own financial resources due to severe mental health and substance issues." The filing further explained that Elijah earns substantial amounts at regular intervals thanks to a trust set up for him by his late father Gregg Allman. Cher told the court that the money "will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah's life at risk."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Elijah Blue Allman was born on July 10, 1976 in Los Angeles, California to singer Cher and her second husband, musician and singer-songwriter Gregg Allman, of the Allman Brothers Band. He is the half-brother of <a href=#>Chaz Bono</a> through his mother, and the half-brother of Delilah, Michael, Layla, and Devon through his father. Allman developed a passion for the guitar early on in life; while on tour with his mother when he was 13, he was given his first guitar by KISS bassist <a href=#>Gene Simmons</a>. He was educated at Hyde School in Bath, Maine, graduating in 1994.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356765 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Elijah-Blue-Allman.jpg alt width=900 height=590 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356765 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Harry Langdon/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=deadsy><strong>Deadsy</strong></h2><p>Allman first came to recognition as the lead vocalist, lyricist, and guitarist of the Los Angeles-based industrial metal band Deadsy, which he formed in 1995 with drummer <a href=# title="Alec Puro Net Worth">Alec Puro</a> and producer Josh Abraham. He later invited his friend Renn Hawkey to join the band on keyboards, and Jay Gordon to join on bass. Originally signed to Sire Records, Deadsy recorded its self-titled debut album in 1996 with a scheduled release early the next year. However, after some promotional versions of the album were released, the album was pulled from commercial release. In 1998, Craig Riker joined the band as the full-time bassist, and Deadsy got to work on recording the album that would become entitled "Commencement." Following multiple delays, that album was finally released in the spring of 2002 by DreamWorks Records. On top of mixed reviews from critics, "Commencement" was a commercial disappointment. Deadsy went on to tour the United States.</p><p>After signing with Immortal Records in 2006, Deadsy released its third album, "Phantasmagore." To promote the album, the band played on the Family Values Tour and at Lollapalooza, and co-headlined a nationwide tour with the Deftones. In early 2007, Deadsy went on hiatus, and the following year, Allman launched the solo project Elijah Blue and the Trapezoids, with which he released some demos on Myspace. Deadsy eventually reformed in late 2018 to play a semi-acoustic show at San Quentin State Prison in San Francisco alongside Queens of the Stone Age. A couple years later, the band teased on social media the release of a forthcoming album entitled "Subterfugue." Despite a scheduled release date in early 2021, however, the album never dropped, and the future of Deadsy was thrown into serious doubt. In 2023, it was confirmed that Renn Hawkey had left the band.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165596 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GettyImages-73929692.jpg alt="Elijah Blue Allman" width=435 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-165596 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter / Getty Images</p><h2 id=featured-appearances><strong>Featured Appearances</strong></h2><p>Allman has appeared as a featured artist on various songs by other artists. In the late 1990s, he contributed vocals and keyboards to songs by the industrial rock band Orgy and the nu metal band Coal Chamber. He also did additional vocals on the song "Personal Space Invader" by the rock band Sugar Ray. Allman went on to reunite with Orgy for the band's 2000 album "Vapor Transmission," lending vocals to the song "The Spectrum." In 2002, he played guitar and bass on the song "Welcome to the Universe" from Thirty Seconds to Mars' debut studio album. Among his other featured credits, Allman contributed vocals to Korn's cover of the song "Love My Way" and to <a href=# title="Mickey Avalon Net Worth">Mickey Avalon</a>'s song "Mickey's Girl."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356766 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Elijah-Blue-Allman2.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356766 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Chelsea Lauren/WireImage)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Allman has dated such celebrities as <a href=# title="Heather Graham Net Worth">Heather Graham</a>, <a href=# title="Kate Hudson Net Worth">Kate Hudson</a>, <a href=# title="Bijou Phillips Net Worth">Bijou Phillips</a>, and <a href=# title="Paris Hilton Net Worth">Paris Hilton</a>.
