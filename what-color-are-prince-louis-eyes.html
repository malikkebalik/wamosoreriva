His full name is Louis Arthur Charles. The meaning of his first name is French for “famous warrior” and the same name as the Duke of Cambridge’s relative Louis Mountbatten. Louis is also Prince George’s middle name and included in William’s full name which is&nbsp;William Arthur Philip Louis. And Charles is of course after Prince Charles.</p><p id=par-9_42>Upon his birth, Louis actually broke a royal record. The day he was born he weighed in at&nbsp;8 pounds 7 ounces&nbsp;which made him not only the heaviest Cambridge baby but also the heaviest heir to the throne in at least 100 years.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>Three tomorrow! ?</p><p>Taken earlier this week by The Duchess before he left for his first&nbsp;day of nursery, The Duke and Duchess are pleased to share a new&nbsp;image of Prince Louis. ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AGgfLI39tW</a></p>— The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href=#>April 22, 2021</a></figure><p id=par-10_32>Louis loves playing outdoors and running around with his big brother and sister.
