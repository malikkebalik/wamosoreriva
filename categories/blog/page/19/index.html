The '90s set teen drama has become the latest streaming show to be axed by Netflix after a single season, but unlike Disjointed, The Gypsy, or Girlboss, Everything Sucks! was notable for its positive representation of a young lesbian's coming out journey. This makes the loss of the show a major one for its small, but loyal fanbase.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'Grey's Anatomy' Fans Hate How Qadri Left the Show, But Sophia Ali Will Be Just Fine</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>
