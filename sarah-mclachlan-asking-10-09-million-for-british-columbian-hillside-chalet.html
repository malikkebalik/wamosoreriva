Is it just a fancy word for super-cool house? Well, it is defined as "a wooden house or cottage with overhanging eaves, typically found in the Swiss Alps." Chalets are not specific to just the Swiss Alps, though. Since 2013. Canadian singer/songwriter <a href=#>Sarah McLachlan</a> has been enjoying one in the town of Whistler, in the Canadian province of British Columbia.&nbsp;For $13.5 million&nbsp;(Canadian),&nbsp;$10.09 million (US), now you can have it.</p><p>The 8,320 square foot hillside mansion is the perfect spot for you and your friends to enjoy some crisp mountain air and serenity, along with some excellent skiing. With five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, you can even invite that weird guy in your group of friends that everyone else thinks smells funny: he can stay in the guesthouse/caretaker cottage, complete with its own private garage.</p><p>Nestled in&nbsp;4.3 acres and surrounded by trees, the house has a beautiful view of the snow-capped Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains.</p><p>The open floor plan combines the living room and dining room on the main floor, making it look like one huge room complete with a stone fireplace and high vaulted ceiling, which helps make the room seem even more spacious than it is. Not that you are likely to&nbsp;spend much time looking at the room, with a view like the one it showcases.</p><p></p><p>You will have more than enough space to cook for everyone in this incredible kitchen, but as with&nbsp;every other room, it will be hard to stay focused on the task at hand because of the view.</p><p>If you actually get tired of looking out the windows, the media room screams of comfort, and will make you wonder how you ever managed to watch television anywhere else.</p><p>The bathroom is larger than the average college kid's apartment&nbsp;–&nbsp;and a lot cleaner!</p><p>When you wake up in this bedroom, you might find it a little hard to get out of bed.</p><p>In case you are wondering, McLachlan isn't giving up the good life. The singer, who released her first album of original music in four years last year, still has a beautiful place located in West Vancouver, British Columbia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGejnruosdGspqefp6e2tbHRZqqaqpGdeq6vy5qaoaSRo3qiv8qipaBlYWV6cYWMpqClpJmku260yKWjrKGUmnqktMClnK1lmaO7bq7Roquiq5hisLC41KaZoplf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-murphy-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Rob Murphy Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
