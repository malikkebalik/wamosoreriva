I understand Strahan is really popular now and he keeps signing on to new gigs. People love him. That’s really all I knew. I had no idea he was with Nicole Murphy, who is Eddie Murphy’s ex-wife and mother to FIVE of Eddie’s kids (four daughters and a son). Michael also has four kids, two kids per two ex-wives. Talk about a complicated blended family, damn. Anyway, Nicole and Michael are over now.</p><p>Michael Strahan is newly single. The Live! with Kelly and Michael co-host and his fiancee Nicole Murphy have split, his rep confirms to Us Weekly.</p><p>“They love each other very much but with the distance and work schedule it has been hard to maintain the relationship,” the rep tells Us in a statement.</p><p>Strahan, 42, and Murphy, 46, got engaged in 2009 after two years of dating. During their relationship, the former NFL star went through several changes in his professional life. In September 2012, he officially joined ABC’s Live! daytime talk show. He also joined the Good Morning America family as an anchor in April.</p><p>Strahan has two grown children with ex-wife Wanda Hutchins and twin 9-year-old daughters with second ex-wife Jean Muggli. Murphy was previously married to comic star Eddie Murphy from 1993 to 2006. The exes share daughters Bria, 24, Shayne, 19, Zola, 14, and Bella, 12, and son Myles, 21.</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>After five years of being engaged (plus two years of dating before that)… it could just be that Nicole realized he was never going to marry her? Or maybe she was gun-shy? I have no idea. I read through <a href=#>Bossip’s comments</a> and I found a treasure-trove of spilled tea though – apparently, there was some shady character Nicole was involved with in between Eddie and Michael and that shady dude might have stolen all of her money (which she got in her divorce settlement from Eddie). Nicole might have thought she landed another <a href=#>whale</a>. Some people think that Michael is just going to trade Nicole in for a younger model. It’s sad but it’s probably true.</p><p>PS… Her bolt-ons are kind of gross-looking. They’re too big and too high for her body.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wenn21149462.jpg alt=wenn21149462 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wenn20165455.jpg alt=wenn20165455 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG9paoN2e8yimqGZlaGstMDRmp%2Bapo%2Bau6W%2FvqGgrJdlYsamrdGYnKefkZyyrrHNrZatp4%2BasaW1xJikrqqgnca0q8Sxlqehk6S5pqvMrqmpoKlk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andre-braugher-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Andre Braugher Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
