The 7'3″ center for the Serbian national team signed a 1-year, $1.2 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs in 2015. He was in and out of the D-League through the season, and when he donned the Spurs jersey he averaged 5 points and 3 rebounds during only 9 minutes per game (it's hard to find playing time behind Tim Duncan, Boris Diaw, LaMarcus Aldridge, and David West).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does Arliss Howard Make?
