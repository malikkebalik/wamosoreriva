It feels like the media is a bit disappointed that Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen aren’t in the middle of a big divorce war. The media was looking forward to covering a big, rich, nasty divorce between two mega-celebrities, and then Tom and Gisele just slipped away and got everything settled in a couple of months, with only a few strategic leaks here and there.
