<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Who is Taylor Swifts song Mean (Taylors Version) about?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=525 data-injectable=true data-video=true>After months of scolding-hot anticipation with sprinkled breadcrumbs tossed in the mix, Swifties, critics, and music lovers alike have finally been rewarded with music superstar <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a></strong>’s new album <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)</a></strong> — which serves as the third official album that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swift has re-recorded</a>. As a result, the highly popular album features an array of familiar tracks which undoubtedly take us along a peaceful stroll down memory lane and remind us all of exactly how we were feeling at the turn of the 2010s.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>From engaging tunes about somber exes to the trials and tribulations of rising through stardom, the album’s tracks are recognizable anthems that many of us have related to during our adolescent years. That being said, there’s one song in particular that wholeheartedly resonates and serves as a kickback to all doubters and detractors — and that would be “Mean (Taylor’s Version).”</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>In the aftermath of the album’s release, Swifties and unaffiliated music fans have revisited a familiar question as to what exactly the backstory of “Mean” entails. So, let’s dive in and explore what the lyrics of Swift’s megahit truly express.</p><h3 id=h-who-is-mean-about data-injectable=false>Who is “Mean” about?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Taylor-Swift-Speak-Now-Taylors-Version.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Prior to the song’s release, Swift had performed at the 2010 Grammy Awards, where her vocals were dissected and heavily criticized. In the days following, a variety of music critics bashed Swift in the headlines — especially analyst Bob Lefsetz, who verbally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked Swift in his column</a> with accusations that she couldn’t sing. And, truthfully, that accusation aged like milk.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Once Lefsetz’s words gained traction online, it was apparent that Swift had read them, which eventually led to her crafting “Mean” on the 2010 album Speak Now. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The song’s lyrics</a> pertain to her “living in a big ol’ city” while the critic is still nothing but “mean” and “pathetic.” Swift also includes lyrics about how she’ll “be big enough” as a musical superstar that the simple words from low-tier critics won’t affect her anymore.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>When asked about the song’s meaning and lyrics, Swift confirmed that the tune was based around a critic’s bashing, explaining that the words hit her hard and that she doesn’t have skin thick enough to simply not let it bother her. Flash forward to now, and it’s clear that Swift has fulfilled her own personal success, so perhaps those words don’t hit as hard as they once did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kqHq0u82gZKadkaN6ta3Ypaarq12rsrO%2FyKilZpmSpMK1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-tren-twins-height-how-tall-are-they.html><span>←</span><span>The Tren Twins height: How tall are they?</span></a>
