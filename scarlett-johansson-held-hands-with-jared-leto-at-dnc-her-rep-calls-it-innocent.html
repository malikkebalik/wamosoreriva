Scarlett has been dating an ad exec named Nate Naylor for <a href=#>at least seven months</a> that we know of. We’ve heard that <a href=#>Nate isn’t the most charming guy</a>, and we’ve heard he’s <a href=#>super jealous of her “friendly” relationship with ex-boyfriend</a>, rocker/actor Jared Leto. I guess Jared and Scarlett dated in 2004. According to a <a href=#>Star story from July</a>, Jared has always held a torch for Scarlett, she’s still receptive to him, and it’s been causing problems in her relationship with Nate. Well according to her rep, Scarlett and Nate are still together, and she was just holding hands, laying all over and getting grabbed on by Jared Leto at the DNC in a friendly way. Scarlett and Jared were looking very loved up. We don’t have access to those photos, but there <a href=#>are plenty on E! Online to see</a>. Here’s E!’s report:</p><p>While Scarlett Johansson took to the podium during the final night of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday to show her support for President Barack Obama, another famous face appeared to be giving the actress a little support, as well.</p><p>As seen in these exclusive photos, it’s none other than Jared Leto, who was romantically linked to Johansson a few years back. But her rep assures us that despite what it may look like in the photos, this was a purely platonic encounter.</p><p>The two cozied next to each other while taking in the festivities along with a star-studded bunch including Jon Hamm, Olivia Wilde, Zach Braff, Don Cheadle and Elizabeth Banks.</p><p>As they watched the action unfold during the convention, Johansson and Leto could be seen holding hands, leaning against each other, conversing, laughing and taking a moment to snap a few pics of themselves.</p><p>At one point, the actor even playfully grabs ScarJo’s ankle as she stands up.</p><p>Johansson’s rep tells E! News, “Scarlett is still dating Nate [Naylor]. This is very innocent. Scarlett and Jared have remained friends, nothing more, nothing less. Let’s concentrate on the DNC and her speech, which is exponentially more important.”</p><p><a href=#>[From E! Online]</a></p><p>It doesn’t look innocent to me, and I bet Nate feels the same. You hang out and chat with your opposite sex friends, you don’t hold hands and lean all over them. Her <a href=#>sun-soaked vacation in Italy with her “bodyguard”</a> this summer didn’t look innocent either. I wonder if she even keeps in touch with her rep.</p><p>Incidentally, Scarlett gave a speech at the DNC trying to get out the youth vote. She focused on her hard upbringing and reminded us that the Democrats fund programs to help lower-income families. She said that she has friends from high school who depend on Planned Parenthood and Medicaid. She also said that young people need to vote because these issues affect them. It was actually a rousing speech and seemed heartfelt. Maybe she was overcome with emotion afterwards and just needed a nice snuggle, and Jared was there. *snicker* Here’s her speech. <a href=#>[via E!]</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/scarjo2-1024x773.jpg alt title=scarjo2 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jaredleto.jpg alt title=jaredleto width=600 sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/scarjo3-1024x764.jpg alt title=scarjo3 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma21ga4Jye9KcmKuklanBoLbOoZinq6Oku6C0xKWbmKCRo7G0q9aiq6GXmJa2s8W%2Bo5irnZSUuabAzpiYrZeknbKgsM2clqGdopS%2Fpry%2BnJilpKOUtrWryKelqJuVo8Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-latifah-net-worth-music-career-lifestyle.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Latifah Net Worth: Music Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</span></a>
