Same shifty stance, same serial killer good looks. His hair is a bit different though, and I apologize for the slightly misleading headline about Bradley admitting to perming his hair because that makes it sound like he does it all the time just for fun. As in, this would completely dovetail with my recent delight at a Star story claiming that Bradley was <a href=#>freaking out over hair loss</a> and had hired his own on-set hairstylist to hide his insecurity.</p><p>Yes, I do think it’s amusing when dudes freak out over a receding hairline because it seems like such a small thing to worry about in comparison to what women have to go through in the aging process. Bradley really seems like a “hair guy” though, and he’s always <a href=#>flaunted his Stamos mane</a> as much as humanly possible, so I guess maybe I shouldn’t poke fun at his alleged panic over losing what he views as a great asset. But back to Bradley’s perm, which was apparently a new style that was initiated for an upcoming role. Here are the details:</p><p>He’s taken the top shot on several lists which source out the members of the male species who are worthy to be called the world’s sexiest men.</p><p>However Bradley Cooper recently made a confession that could see him falling down the rankings. The handsome 38-year-old Hangover star revealed that he perms his hair.</p><p>Bradley made the shock admission while speaking to E! News during the BAFTA Tea reception. Luckily the actor explained that he only had the curling treatment done for his latest role in which he’ll co-star alongside Christian Bale.</p><p>Making light of the not so sexiest man in the world experience, over the weekend Cooper said: “I permed my hair today.”</p><p>Going into further detail about the procedure, Bradley continued: “We did a camera test today and we were playing with the idea of him having curly hair. Like rollers! Oh, yeah bro, like rollers in the hair!”</p><p>In the untitled film, which will be directed by David O. Russell and was written by Eric Singer, Cooper will play a character called Jimmy Boyle.</p><p>The movie which is currently in post-production is based around a FBI sting operation in the 1970s called Abscam which led to the conviction of United States Congressmen.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>]</p><p>The Mail has apparently confused post-production with pre-production, but that doesn’t really matter to this story. Essentially, Bradley admits to perming his hair before the Golden Globes, where he looked like this:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn20061501.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>So basically, now I am obsessed with looking at Bradley’s “new” hair from every angle:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn20064816.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn20065542.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn20065563.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Does he really look that different? It’s a very subtle perm, which is not exactly “curly” like those perms of the late 1980s. Man, I used to have some really big hair in those days, and my dad really enjoys embarrassing me with photo evidence of my former Rave hairspray addiction. But hey, at least I never blew kisses at anyone like Bradley was doing on the red carpet yesterday. Strange.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn20065545.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn20064814.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma29kbn1ze8GrmJ2kla6spLvOqZyrl5GZuqrA0pirqJegmr%2Butc2glqGho5S1orXRmJ%2BorI%2Bssqq%2Bw5imq5eepKyjtcaYm56ZnGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./50-games-like-starcraft-for-ios-iphone.html><span>←</span><span>50 Games Like StarCraft for IOS iPhone</span></a>
