They combined the property into one brand-new mansion with 14,000 square feet of living space, 2,100 square feet of outdoor space, and 50 feet of street frontage.</p><p>While they were finishing up their ambitious property development project in New York, they lived in a nearby townhouse that they purchased way back in 2000 for $2.995 million. They also renovated this property. They lived in this home for much of the two decades between 2000 and 2002. In January of 2020 the couple listed this townhouse for sale for $19 million.
