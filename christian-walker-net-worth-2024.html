Christian is well-known for being the son of NFL legend Herschel Walker. He is also an accomplished cheerleader, having led the Spirit of Texas Royalty squad to first place at the 2016 World Championship of All-Star Cheerleading. Christian Walker has recently come to light as a result of a series of tweets directed at his father, Herschel Walker, a potential Republican candidate for Georgia’s senate seat. Christian chastised his father for abandoning his family, describing him as a liar, hypocrite, and unfit “family man.”<br>“I don’t care about someone who has a bad past but accepts responsibility.” But how dare you LIE and pretend to be some moral, Christian, upright man?’ You’ve spent your life DESTROYING other people’s lives. “How dare you,” Christian Walker retweeted.</p><p>Christian Walker also claimed that his father abandoned his family and that Christian is not a family man. Not only that, but Christian accused Herschel of abandoning his family in order to bang other women. “You also threatened to kill us and relocate us six times in six months as a result of your violence,” Christian added. Christian revealed that Herschel Walker’s entire family had asked him not to run for office due to his history. Herschel, on the other hand, decided to “show a middle finger” to everyone and “air out all of his dirty laundries in public, while simultaneously lying about it,” Christian explained.</p><h2>Christian Walker’s net worth</h2><p>Christian Walker has a net worth of $545,000 USD as a cheerleader.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6cn6uho6m2orqMsJilo5Wneq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-pair-of-stephen-curry-s-game-worn-sneakers-sold-for-over-30-000.html><span>←</span><span>A Pair Of Stephen Curry's Game-Worn Sneakers Sold For Over $30,000!</span></a>
