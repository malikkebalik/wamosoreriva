She has given herself a position of importance within the Brown family and made herself central in Kody’s world. However, in doing so, she became a giant wall separating Kody from his family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-brown-tries-to-explain-kody-brown-s-thought-process-to-no-avail>Robyn Brown tries to explain Kody Brown’s thought process to no avail</h2><p id=par-2_37>Robyn Brown has tried, for many years, to explain <a href=#>Kody Brown’s thought process</a> to his fellow family members and the series’ viewers. She has become his spokesperson and, reportedly, was the one person who knew him best.</p><p id=par-3_34>However, she appears only to cause more strife than family unity. Robyn has spent season after season speaking about how she is the only person who understands Kody and, therefore, must translate his wishes.</p><p id=par-4_38>Somehow, Robyn convinced Meri, Christine, and Janelle Brown that could help them understand their own husband. Why Kody’s three previous wives, who had <a href=#>decades of marriage</a> with him, allowed Robyn to position herself in that manner is uncertain.</p><p id=par-5_27>But, position herself she did, and Kody, in turn, deferred to Robyn for all of his decisions—even those concerning his other wives. Thus, <a href=#>she created a monster</a>.</p><p id=par-6_28>Therefore, she became a giant wall that separated Kody from his three other wives and their children. It was impossible for anyone to reach Kody without Robyn’s interference.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-fed-up-with-how-robyn-brown-behaves>Fans are fed up with how Robyn Brown behaves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/robyn-brown-sister-wives.jpg><p id=par-7_39>In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> post, fans spoke out about how Robyn Brown has historically behaved within the Brown family. They appeared frustrated that she speaks for Kody Brown when he remains quite capable of taking care of his own matters.</p><p id=par-8_57>“I’m pretty sure after 30 odd years of marriage they all ‘spoke Kody,'” said one Redditor. “They didn’t suddenly have a new relationship with him because now they could be told what he was thinking. He’s pretty vocal about that and has no filter, so if it crosses that Kody brain, it comes out the Kody mouth.”</p><p id=par-9_39>It continued, “That Robyn is explaining to him what is being said. I also cringe because he may be many things, but he is foolish and inarticulate, isn’t he? So this whole line of ‘speak Kody’ is just nonsense.”</p><p id=par-10_77>Another fan said, “There were many times Robyn would stop Kody in mid-sentence to tell him he needs to be ‘in your right mind’ when she knew he was going to say something that did not favor her or her kids. One example is when they were all at the property and swam in the ‘pond.’ Kody was going to say something, and Robyn jumped, telling Kody he needed to eat first before he made any decisions.”</p><p id=par-11_20>However, at least two of his now former wives spoke out against Robyn’s machinations. Here’s what they had to say.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-christine-and-janelle-brown-said-they-did-fine-without-robyn-brown-s-interference>Christine and Janelle Brown said they did fine without Robyn Brown’s interference</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_31>During the season 18 tell-all for Sister Wives, Christine and Janelle Brown didn’t mince about Robyn Brown’s interference in their relationships with Kody. They were downright ticked off over Robyn’s behavior.</p><p id=par-13_31>“I met him when I was 18. I’ve known Kody for a long time, and I can actually read Kody pretty well. And I can speak Kody well, too,” said Christine.</p><p id=par-14_35>Janelle agreed with Christine’s assessment of the situation. She added, “Well, I don’t know if I really need someone to translate for me. We’ve been married for a long time. We did OK without you.”</p><p id=par-15_17>Sister Wives is currently on hiatus. The series returns to TLC for <a href=#>season 19</a> sometime in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR50aiZsqZdl7%2Bww81mnqKZnql6uK3LpWSkp5SueqO%2BzrClZp6ipLpussCmoKWxXp3BrriO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jin-xing-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Jin Xing Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
