Katherine, 33, rocked an all-black ensemble with a see-through neckline. Her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Chris Pratt</b></a><span>, also walked the red carpet with the Schwarzenegger clan. The </span><i><span>Guardians of the Galaxy </span></i><span>star, 43, opted for a more casual look with a plaid shirt and a windbreaker.&nbsp;</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>Christina, 31, wore a gold two-piece set with striped details and a belted waist. Also in attendance at the event was Arnold’s son </span><a href=#><b>Joseph Baena</b></a><span>, whom he shares with </span><b>Mildred Baena</b><span>.

He teamed up with </span><b>Monica Barbaro</b><span> to play a father-daughter pair secretly working as CIA operatives who are forced to tackle a project as partners.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Well, I’m glad that he’s here today watching </span><i><span>FUBAR</span></i><span>,” the former professional bodybuilder said of his son’s arrival at the event while chatting with </span><a href=#><i><span>Entertainment Tonight</span></i></a><span> on the red carpet. “We’re supporting each other, and that’s the important thing.”</span></p><p><span>Joseph, 25, echoed his father’s gratitude for spending time together and supporting each other’s projects.</span></p><p><span>“He’s an amazing father. He’s a great person to look up to and he’s the smartest man I know,” the fitness model told the outlet. “It’s been a great journey and he’s always been so supportive of whatever I do.”</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>Joseph has been paving a career of his own as an actor and bodybuilder over the past few years, proud to be following in Arnold’s footsteps.&nbsp;</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>“So, I’m just really grateful to have a dad like him,” he gushed.&nbsp;</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>Arnold is also a dad to kids</span><a href=#><b> Patrick</b><span> and </span><b>Christopher</b> <b>Schwarzenegger</b></a><span> with his ex-wife, </span><b>Maria Shriver</b><span>. While they were not in attendance at the event, both boys have a great relationship with their dad.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“My vision was to create great kids,” Arnold told </span><i><span>GQ Germany</span></i><span> in May 2019 of his bond with Patrick. “What I’m proud of is that I could kind of show him the way and he knew that he has all the help in the world from me all the time but that he had to do the work also.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see photos of Arnold and his children at the </b><b><i>FUBAR </i></b><b>premiere.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46aqaennJl6tK%2FHsJirspWjsqizxKtkpKGUqHqiwNOepZ1llqqvor6MqamepZmav6Z5z6GmraejZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./words-longer-than-antidisestablishmentarianism.html><span>←</span><span>Words Longer Than Antidisestablishmentarianism</span></a>
