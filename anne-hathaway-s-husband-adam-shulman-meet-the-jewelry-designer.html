Luckily, that all changed when she met <strong>Adam Shulman</strong>. The beloved&nbsp;<a href=#>Princess Diaries</a> star — who is <a href=#>currently pregnant with the couple’s second child</a> — has never seemed happier since tying the knot with her handsome hunk over seven years ago.</p><p>Although Anne, 36, keeps much of their lives private, she has opened up many times in the past regarding their fairytale love story. In fact, the <a href=#>Academy Award-winning actress</a> once revealed she told her friend that Adam, 38, was The One for her when they first met at the Palm Springs Film Festival in fall 2008.</p><p>“I’m going to marry that man,” she told the U.K. version of <a class=body-link href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a32542/when-bazaar-met-anne-hathaway/>Harper’s BAZAAR</a> in 2014 of what she confided to her close pal. “I knew from the second I met him that he was the love of my life.” Anne opened up even further, revealing trust issues from past relationships took a toll on her when the two first crossed paths.</p><p>“I was just very honest with him,” the&nbsp;Oceans 8 star&nbsp;explained. “I also knew that I couldn’t have met him at a worse time … I took my trust out for a ridiculous joyride with him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/adam-shulman-anne-hathaway-husband-facts07.jpg><p>Around the time she met Adam, Anne was right in the middle of ex-boyfriend <strong>Raffaello Follieri</strong>‘s legal troubles. In 2008, the Italian businessman was imprisoned for fraud after he was secretly funneling money from his charities for years after he met Anne in 2004.</p><p>“[I told Adam,] ‘I believe, because I need to believe, that what just happened to me was the exception and not the rule, and that people are good and you are a good person, because I feel it,'” Anne explained, despite being hurt from former romances. “And so I am not in a good place right now, but I’m going with this. And he has never hurt me.”</p><p>Looking back on their envious romance, Anne gushed to <a href=#>ELLE</a> in 2017 about how Adam impacted her life. “He changed my ability to be in the world comfortably,” she shared at the time. “I think the accepted narrative now is that we, as women, don’t need anybody. But I need my husband. His unique and specific love has changed me.”</p><p>Anne and Adam are total marriage goals!</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn 5 fun facts about Anne’s hubby, Adam!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apaedXZ2utbTAsJiyq12dwrSuwKebZpmUlrpuv8euo6aZnmK6prHTZquhnV2fsrixy6uwZpyVqLaousSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-and-where-you-can-watch-a-house-made-of-splinters.html><span>←</span><span>When and Where You Can Watch A House Made of Splinters?</span></a>
