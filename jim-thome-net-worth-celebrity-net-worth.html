He became their designated hitter.</p><p>In 2009 Thome was traded to the L.A. Dodgers, but the only position he was given is that of pinch hitter. In 2010 he began playing for the Minnesota Twins and on August 15th he hit his two career home runs which brought the total up to 600. In 2011 he was traded back to the Cleveland Indians and later that year he signed to play for the Philadelphia Phillies once again and in 2012 was traded back to the Baltimore Orioles. He is in seventh place on the all-time list for hitters with 610 career home runs.
