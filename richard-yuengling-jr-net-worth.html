Richard Yuengling, Jr. has secured his place among American billionaires as the fifth-generation owner of America's oldest operating brewery, D.G. Yuengling & Son. Set up in 1829 as Eagle Brewery, the business has also turned into one of the largest breweries by volume in the country. Despite of the company's rise on the one hand, and steep competition and frequent acquisitions in the beer industry on the other, the Pottsville-based company stubbornly remains private.</p><p>Today, it generates annual sales of more than $400 million with over 2.5 million barrels of beer sold each year. Being the sole owner of such brewery for Yuengling means wearing jeans and driving an old car rather than selling out and flaunting his wealth. To date, he has seen his company spread across 14 states and plans to keep it that way. Saying he couldn't even get along with his own father at the time, Richard Yuengling, Jr. has turned down offers from all the major players in the industry and vows never to sell the business. It was in 1985 that he bought out his dad when revenues were only $6 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqjtculoKimkZ6%2Fpr%2BOq6CcoJGnsW7F1J6loKSZo7RuttFmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristen-bell-s-net-worth-books-career.html><span>←</span><span>Kristen Bells Net Worth : Books &amp;amp; Career</span></a>
