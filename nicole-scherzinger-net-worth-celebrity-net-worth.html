After working hard to pursue a career in music, Scherzinger eventually achieved international stardom when she joined the girl group the Pussycat Dolls, which was originally founded as a burlesque troupe.</p><p>Outside of her work with the Pussycat Dolls, Scherzinger has achieved notable success as a solo artist. In addition, she has become an established television personality with a number of appearances in various reality TV shows. A driven entrepreneur, Scherzinger has also explored a number of additional business pursuits, such as clothing lines.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Nicole Prescovia Elikolani Valiente was born on June 29th of 1978 in Honolulu, Hawaii. She was raised in a Catholic household, although her parents separated soon after she was born. Nicole's mother took custody of her and relocated the family to Louisville, Kentucky. Nicole's new stepfather was a German American named Gary Scherzinger, and she took his last name when he officially adopted her.</p><p>After high school, Nicole attended Wright State University on a scholarship, majoring in theater arts while also studying dance as a minor. While she was still a college student, Scherzinger began performing in various musical productions.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Nicole Scherzinger began her musical career in 1999 when she collaborated with the band Days of the New. After providing vocals on their album, Scherzinger dropped out of college to tour with the band. A few years later, she appeared on the reality TV show Popstars, which was essentially a precursor to the Idol franchise.

She not only won a spot, but she also became the lead singer with most of the vocal responsibilities. In addition, she was the only band member to have songwriting credits on their debut album, PCD. The 2005 album featured the breakthrough track "Don't Cha," which elevated Scherzinger and the Pussycat Dolls to international stardom.</p><p>Now that Scherzinger had established herself with the Pussycat Dolls, she could pursue her solo career with greater ease. In 2006, she started to collaborate with artists such as Avant and Diddy on singles that allowed her to chart as a solo artist for the first time.</p><p>However, the Pussycat Dolls needed Scherzinger's full attention to help them finish their second album, which would turn out to be their last. In 2004, the group released Doll Domination, which debuted at number four on the Billboard Top 200. Many of the album's most notable tracks were originally written by Scherzinger for her solo album. Another song by Scherzinger also featured on the soundtrack of Slumdog Millionaire. Scherzinger's central role in the group began to cause internal friction, and the Pussycat Dolls officially went on a hiatus in 2009.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302799 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Nicole-Scherzinger.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1445px) 100vw, 1445px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302799 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</p><p>Following this hiatus, Nicole Scherzinger immediately found work as a judge on the first season of The Sing-Off.
