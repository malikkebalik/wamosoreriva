<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>9 Excellent Clint Dempsey Memes, Because Who Doesn't Love USMNT's Captain America?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>He scored the first goal of this year's U.S. World Cup run, which also happened to be the fifth quickest goal scored in World Cup history. He heroically broke his nose against Ghana. Under Dempsey's leadership, this U.S. team became the first to advance to the knock-out round two World Cups in a row. And even if the <a href=# class=T3D>U.S.'s loss to Belgium</a> Tuesday proved the knock-out round would be as far as 2014 team would go, you have to salute Dempsey's leadership. He's the captain and champion of the red, white, and blue. But most importantly, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Clint Dempsey is one of the Internet's favorite World Cup sweethearts</a>, perhaps second only to <a href=# class=T3D>Future President Tim Howard</a>.</p><p>Since the U.S. transplanted itself to Brazil last month, the Internet has had a lot of fun with our captain's meme-ability. With a wide-open scoring mouth, an eagle-like wing span, and the easily transferable title of "Captain America," Dempsey has opened himself to Photoshop fun that has stretched through the weeks.</p><p>And man, has the Internet delivered. It gave us rainbows, eagles, and an influx of our nation's colors. It's enough to make you want to scarf down one million hot dogs and train your pet eagle to cry out the national anthem at once. That is, assuming, that you have a pet eagle. But dammit, doesn't Dempsey want to make you buy a pet eagle?!</p><p>Suffice to say, Dempsey and the Internet have been the pivotal part of the U.S.'s World Cup spirit. Lucky you, we've rounded up our favorite memes surrounding the captain.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>If this was the first thing that we saw while boating into NYC, we'd be pretty content.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>I think R. Kelly said it best here: "I BELIEVE I CAN FLY."</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>This just rounded up every one of my favorite Internet attributes: Space, rainbow vomit, KITTENS?! Oh yeah, and all of that somehow relates to Dempsey. Somehow.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Oh, come on now. What does your game face look like?</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Guns and middle fingers, AMERIKAH.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>I feel like someone made this in serious patriotic spirit, which, despite it being hilari-bad, makes it instantly fantastic.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Mountain an eagle and riding our way to victory. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>I don't know how the hell Dempsey got to ride a unicorn into space, but you bet that he's going to take an American flag to plant on the moon when he gets there. On a unicorn. Because America.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>And, of course, this wouldn't be complete without a muscle car with guns mounted on it. With an eagle perched close by. Thank you, Dempsey.
