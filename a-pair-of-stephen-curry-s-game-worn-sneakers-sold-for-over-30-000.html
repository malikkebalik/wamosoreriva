The shoes were worn during the Warriors' 103-90 win over the New York Knicks on Dec. 15, and were inscribed with the words "Oakland Strong." The sneakers, which are also autographed by the two-time NBA MVP, were worn in order to honor the 36 victims who died in a fire at the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland last month.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The shoes that Curry wore while warming up for the game&nbsp;<a href=#>sold for $15,100 on eBay</a>. The proceeds from both shoes will go to the Oakland Fire Relief fund. The fund raised $547,096 of a $550,000 goal before the auction for both shoes ended, an amount that was bolstered by $50,000 donations from the Warriors, Oakland Raiders, and Oakland Athletics.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-211679 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GettyImages-477179090.jpg alt="(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)" width=900 height=558 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-211679 class=wp-caption-text>(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The record price paid for a pair of shoes worn by a player that was active at the time of the sale was set in 2014, when a buyer paid $37,740 for a pair of shoes worn by <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a> during the 2008 Olympics.
