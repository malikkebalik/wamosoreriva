He has been presenting the famous BBC News At Six since 3 December 2007.</p><p>George is also the author of A Passage to Africa and Home from Home. He also published his first novel back on September 5, 2019 “The Burning Land”. &nbsp;</p><p>Alagiah’s broadcasting career is quite impressive if you ask me. He served as a print journalist for seven years in South Magazines and in 1989 he joined the BBC. He was the BBC’s leading foreign correspondent.</p><p>George became the presenter of BBC Four News after its launch in 2002. He also worked with&nbsp;Sophie Raworth at the BBC Six O’Clock News from January 2003 until October 2005.</p><p>Also read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Is Jim Acosta Gay Or Does He Have A New Wife?

He still worked till 2021 until he took a short break.</p><p>George returned to BBC’s News at Six in April 2022 and in a statement he said: “A recent scan showed that my cancer has spread further so it’s back to some tough stuff”.</p><p>Alagiah also stated that he misses his workplace and colleague. It was hard for him to not attend the newsroom since it was such an important part of his life to keep him energized and motivated.</p><p>Day by day George Alagiah health is getting worse however he is focused on life and fighting death as his cancer spreads. He remains optimistic and looks forward to getting back in the studio as soon as he can.</p><p>George Alagiah health remains the same and he confirmed that the cancer was incurable and had spread to his liver, lungs, and lymph nodes in an interview with&nbsp;The Times back in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Top-g0.jpg><p>After Alagiah’s initial diagnosis 8 years ago, he has undergone 17 rounds of chemotherapy. He said he had a better chance of survival if England had the same screening system for bowel cancer as Scotland.</p><p>The screening system for bowel cancer in Scotland starts at the age of 50 for both males and females. But that’s not the case with England since it starts at 60. Had England started screening at 50 just like Scotland he could be screened at least 4 times by the time he reaches the age of 60.&nbsp;</p><p>George also said “survival rates are tremendous if you catch cancer early” and complained about Scotland using it and not England. Since then he has campaigned to lower the screening age in England for bowel cancer.</p><p>In Uk, bowel cancer kills more than 16,000 people every year. It is considered the second most common cause of death after lung cancer in the Uk.</p><h2>Meet George Alagiah Wife Frances</h2><p>George got married to Frances Robathan in 1984.
