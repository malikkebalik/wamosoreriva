Here’s our look at Kim Namjoon’s zodiac sign and his birth chart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RM was born on Sept. 12, 1994</h2><p id=par-2_44>With a birthday in September, RM is one of the older members in BTS. Born on Sept. 12, RM a Virgo, along with celebrities like Beyoncé, Zendaya, and Nick Jonas. Virgos are known for many things, but they’re perhaps best known for their perfectionism.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_48>That perfectionism can sometimes spill over into their work, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. A good thing because it’s this leadership and vision that helped RM succeed. A bad thing because there’s always more to be done to make music, or anything, better.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RM’s moon sign is Sagittarius&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_42>Based on where he was born, Goyang, South Korea, fans can figure out RM’s birth chart and learn a little bit more about the astrology behind this rapper. The moon sign of Kim Namjoon, which details more of his emotions, is Saggitarius.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_37>“The Moon in Sagittarius has a mission, and can’t be held back by outdated relationships or conventions. Jupiter rules this Moon’s sign, and that means your eyes are on the future,” <a href=#>Live About </a>writes of Sagittarius moons.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_54>This is super accurate for RM, as well as most of the members in BTS. Despite their past, the performers worked their way up to become one of the biggest boy bands in the world. They became the first K-pop group to perform at the Grammy Awards. RM even spoke at the United Nations.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM-BTS-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RM’s ‘rising sign’ is Scorpio&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_39>The sun and moon signs aren’t the only parts of astrology that help describe a person. Because his rising sign is Scorpio, according to <a href=#>Live About</a>, RM can be described as “mesmerizing, secretive, confident, ambitious, self-controlled, intimidating, and soulful.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_36>Scorpios are water signs, which means they generally find their strength in their emotions. We totally see that for RM, who acts as somewhat of a support system for the other members in the K-pop group.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_52>However, Scorpios also are known for having an icy disposition when they have their guard up. Get them around the right group of people, though, and they’ll be super honest and confident. That’s especially true for RM and his music, which often gives fans a look into the mind of the performer.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_34>The “Dynamite” music video is now available on YouTube. Music by BTS, including their recently released album, Map of the Soul: 7, is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, and most major platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZaKieqe%2BzqZkm6yjYq%2BqvtOhZJygkafBbsbOnaCam12otqi6jaGrpqRf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-is-the-real-couple-a-walk-to-remember-was-based-on.html><span>←</span><span>This Is the Real Couple 'A Walk to Remember' Was Based On</span></a>
