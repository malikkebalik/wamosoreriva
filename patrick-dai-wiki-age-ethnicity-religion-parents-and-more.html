It’s been reported that Dai, who is studying computer science, was arrested on federal charges related to recent threats made against Jewish students at Cornell.</p><p>According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Syracuse, he was taken into custody based on a federal criminal complaint, accusing him of posting threats to harm other students. These threatening messages were posted on an online forum section dedicated to Cornell University.</p><p>These incidents occurred during a time when there was a noticeable increase in hate crimes targeting Jewish and Muslim individuals across the country. These tensions were exacerbated by the conflict involving Hamas militants in Israel and the subsequent military actions, including airstrikes and a ground invasion by the Israeli Defense Forces.</p><p>In response to the threats made at Cornell University, Governor Hochul visited the campus to address the situation and send a clear message to students that such threats will not be tolerated.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Patrick Dai's horrific messages" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patrick-Dais-horrific-messages.webp alt="Patrick Dai's horrific messages" width=400 height=323 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Dai’s Antisemitic Posts&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The complaint outlines that Patrick Dai is accused of posting menacing messages on a Cornell University online discussion platform. These posts included calls for harm to Jewish individuals, such as one that mentioned “gonna shoot up 104 west.”</p><p>To provide context, 104 West is a Cornell University dining hall known for serving predominantly Kosher food and is situated near the Cornell Jewish Center, where Cornell students live. In another post, Dai purportedly made threats to harm Jewish males on campus, with mentions of “stabbing” and “throat-slitting.”</p><p>He also allegedly made disturbing threats towards Jewish females, implying acts of violence, and even mentioned harming Jewish babies. In the same post, he threatened to bring an assault rifle to campus and target individuals he referred to as “pig jews.”</p><p><img decoding=async title="Cornell University Student Patrick Dai" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cornell-University-Student-Patrick-Dai.webp alt="Cornell University Student Patrick Dai" width=400 height=496 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Patrick Dai’s Arrested&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Patrick was taken into custody on October 31, 2023, after authorities became aware of messages he had posted. This is a very serious case, and it is being thoroughly investigated by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), which includes the New York State Police, in collaboration with the Cornell University Police Department and the Ithaca Police Department.</p><p>The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York is handling the prosecution, working in conjunction with the Counterterrorism Section of the Department of Justice.</p><p>The charge against Dai carries significant consequences, including a maximum potential prison sentence of up to 5 years, a fine of up to $250,000, and a period of supervised release of up to 3 years.</p><p>The specific sentence a defendant may receive is determined by a judge, taking into account the relevant statute the defendant is accused of violating, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, and various other factors.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Vitali GossJankowski Wiki, Age, Parents, Girlfriend, Ethnicity and More</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="Patrick Dai LinkedIn" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patrick-Dai-LinkedIn.webp alt="Patrick Dai LinkedIn" width=400 height=411 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>What do we Know About Patrick Dai?</strong></h2><p>In 2002, Patrick Dai (age 21) was born in New York, United States.
