The original Aunt Viv from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (played by actress Janet Hubert for the first three seasons) sent her former co-stars a very angry message after one of the sitcom’s actor’s Alfonso Ribeiro (Carlton Banks) posted a cast reunion photo on Instagram — without her in it!
On Tuesday, March 28 Alfonso shared a sweet pic of himself, Will Smith (Wil Smith), Tatyana Ali (Ashley Banks), Karyn Parsons (Hilary Banks), and Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey Butler)."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
