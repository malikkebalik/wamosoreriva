Over the course of The WB's family medical drama's four seasons, Everwood played host to many big names — some already huge stars, others stars in the making. Even those of you who know the show like the back of your own hands will find a few surprises in this list of <a href=# class=T3D>17 Everwood guest stars you totally forgot about</a>.</p><p>Now, some of these guest stars were on Everwood for as many as 15 episodes, but most only popped up in one or two, making them not only true guest stars, but also slightly more forgettable for casual fans. The guest stars fans are most likely to remember are the ones who guest starred on Everwood only to star in a CW show years later — your Justin Baldoni, for example. But then there are the more obscure guest stars, like pre-Fantastic Four Kate Mara, that even the most avid Everwood fans have either forgotten about, or just didn't realize at the time would end up taking over Hollywood. Whether or not you remember everyone on the list, taking a look at these <a href=# class=T3D>famous Everwood guest stars</a> will, if nothing else, be the trip down memory lane you need right now.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Kristen Bell As Stacey Wilson</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Warner Brothers Television Distribution</p></figure><p>Kristen Bell guest starred as Stacey Wilson, an Everwood cheerleader who hurts her wrist after taking a bad fall, in the Season 2 episode "Extra Ordinary."
