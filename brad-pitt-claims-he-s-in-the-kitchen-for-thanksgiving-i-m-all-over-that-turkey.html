I really like the “hot professor” vibe Brad Pitt has in these photos. It’s a much better vibe than <a href=#>the “I’m wearing a ‘90s wiglet” energy</a> from The Big Short premiere. These photos are just of Brad out and about in NYC on Tuesday, likely going back and forth to media outlets to promote The Big Short. He wore that newsboy cap so I have no idea if he’s still trying to work a wiglet, or if the real wiglet is <a href=#>the “grey hair” he’s rocking for War Machine</a>. Anyway, there are some assorted quotes floating around from Brad, including his thoughts on the world of finance today, and whether he’s going to do any cooking for Thanksgiving.</p><p><strong>Whether he’s in the kitchen for Thanksgiving:</strong> “Yeah, I’ll get in there, I’ll mess it up a little bit. We got Thanksgiving, man — I’m all over that turkey.”</p><p><strong>His secret to staying young-looking:</strong> “Everything in moderation and a lot of love.”</p><p><strong>Filming The Big Short in NOLA: </strong>“I like any excuse to get back to New Orleans.”</p><p><strong>The best thing about getting older:</strong> “You just get more and more chill.”</p><p><strong>Telling the story of the 2008 financial crisis:</strong> “It was a really important story to me, I’m still angry by it, that no one was held accountable, this financial crisis, this housing meltdown that so many people got hurt by. I’m angry. I’m angry that so many people lost their homes. Families were put on the street, they lost their life savings, and yet no one was held accountable. No senior official was held accountable. That’s amazing.”</p><p><strong>He’s worried nothing has changed: </strong>“There’s something seriously wrong, you talk to the experts now and they say nothing’s changed. The entitlement to make money without responsibility still exists, it’s alive and well. And the same practices are still going on, only in different arenas. But nothing’s changed. That’s a problem.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Extra</a> & <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>Angelina Jolie has said over and over again that she can’t cook and she’s a disaster in the kitchen. So is Brad cooking Thanksgiving? Is he just in charge of the turkey and he makes the kids do the other stuff? The thing is, if you’re helpless in the kitchen, you can buy a lot of pre-made stuff. I wonder if that’s what they do. As for Brad’s thoughts on the financial crisis… yes, it is depressing. Ugh.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FFN_GG_Pitt_Brad_112415_51917395.jpg alt=FFN_GG_Pitt_Brad_112415_51917395 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW1oa4B1e8GrmJ2XoJ7BtavCpZiipaOUtaa%2FvqKlmKyYmqystdOcn56mj5u8s6vToZino6Octre1zaCWoqWPlrmtq86vnKuXpJ2utavTrqmknalk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-watson-once-remembered-causing-carnage-with-ezra-miller-in-perks-of-being-a-wallflower.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
