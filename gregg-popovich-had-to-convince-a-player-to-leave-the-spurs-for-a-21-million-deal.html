Ultimately, he signed a <strong>3-year, $21 million</strong> deal with the Detroit Pistons, an offer the Spurs were unable to match.</p><p>Given the inflated contract the Spurs had to offer <a href=# title="Manu Ginobili Net Worth">Manu Ginobili</a> to keep him out of a 76ers uniform, and the 2-year, $30 million deal they signed with veteran All-Star <a href=# title="Pau Gasol Net Worth">Pau Gasol</a>, the Spurs simply didn't have the cap room to offer comparable cash to the Serbian. Had he remained in San Antonio, he would likely have signed a similar deal to the one given to his replacement, Dewayne Dedmon, which was good for 2 years and $6 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-206559 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/greg-popovich.jpg alt="(Stephen Dunn/Getty Images)" width=900 height=605 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-206559 class=wp-caption-text>(Stephen Dunn/Getty Images)</p><p>According to head coach <a href=# title="Gregg Popovich Net Worth">Gregg Popovich</a>, Marjanovic wasn't initially keen on taking the offer:</p><p>"He's such a good kid, at some point I had to work to get him to understand that $21 million was different than $3 million," Popovich said. "I said, 'Get your ass out of here. Go. You've got to do it.' But he felt bad."</p><p>I'm sure after a year making $7 million for playing back-up center in Detroit, Marjanovic will be just fine with the decision he made.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqCpnp%2BXYr2wvM6voJygXZi8r8LIp5qeZaChrrqx0Wajnpmmmnq0vNSrqmZqYWK6qrjLoqanZZSarq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-kimmy-gibbler-have-a-brother.html><span>←</span><span>Did Kimmy Gibbler Have a Brother?</span></a>
