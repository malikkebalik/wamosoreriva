Some fans of the 007 film series didn't care too much for the Heineken promotion in the movie Skyfall, which apparently brought with it a $45 million price tag. This time, James Bond star <a href=#>Daniel Craig</a> turned down a <strong>$50 million</strong> offer for Bond to carry an Android smartphone.</p><p>Both Sony and Samsung made offers for Bond to carry a smartphone in the newest 007 film,&nbsp;Spectre. Sony first offered $5 million along with an $18 million bid to be the exclusive smartphone vendor of the series. Samsung stepped up their offer to a total of $50 million. Spectre actor Daniel Craig and director <a href=#>Sam Mendes</a> turned them both down, after deciding that the phones were too lackluster for James Bond to carry.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-172927 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-463769094.jpg alt="VINCENZO PINTO,TIZIANA FABI/AFP/Getty Images" width=900 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-172927 class=wp-caption-text>VINCENZO PINTO,TIZIANA FABI/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Craig earned a co-producing credit for Spectre, and he and Mendes have cemented their place in the Bond franchise, which comes with a lot of pull. They were able to have the final word on whether or not Mr. Bond would carry a phone and what type it would be. Although Sony's Xperia Z5 was not featured in Spectre, Sony was able to feature Moneypenny in a mini-series for the phone. Bond's gadget man Q doesn't have a smartphone in the movie, but instead has an Omega Master watch.</p><p>Many people recognize Android phones as being accessible in price so it seems unlikely that James Bond would have something that everyone could afford.&nbsp; The latest Bond film Spectre was a big success in its opening weekend in the UK and performed better than Skyfall.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-172928 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-459923996.jpg alt="BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images" width=900 height=609 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-172928 class=wp-caption-text>BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Spectre marks the fourth time that Craig has played the role of James Bond in the film series. His first role came in 2006's Casino Royale, which made $599 million on a $150 million budget. Craig also starred as Bond in Quantum of Solace, in 2008, which made $586 million on a $200 million budget. Skyfall was able to reach the billion dollar mark in 2012, making <strong>$1.1 billion</strong> on a budget of $150 to $200 million. In its first weekend in the UK alone, Spectre was able to take in $300 million on a reduced $80 million budget.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJooZqllah6o7vNnWSsrJGneqWtzaKcpWWTp66qs4ydnJykmaOytHmUaWSmoZyhtrC6jKmpqJylmMFuvMuamp6llaPBbr%2FPnpqtqpVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clare-crawley-speaks-out-after-dale-moss-cheating-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Clare Crawley Speaks Out After Dale Moss Cheating Scandal</span></a>
