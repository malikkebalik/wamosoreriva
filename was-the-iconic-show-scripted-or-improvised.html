<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Was The Iconic Show Scripted or Improvised?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p id=par-1_81>We could live a thousand lifetimes and never deserve the comedic brilliance that is The Office. Spanning nine seasons and eight years, the show premiered on NBC back in March of 2005. Filled with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="office romances (opens in a new tab)" href=#>office romances</a>, ridiculous situations, outlandish characters, and plenty of laugh out loud moments the show is a real riot. A documentary-style show, so much of the series feels natural and true to life. Which begs the question, is The Office even scripted, or is it 100% improvised?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Office-Cast.jpg><h2>Scripted or Improvised</h2><p id=par-2_79>With comedic legend Steve Carell (who played the infamous Michael Scott) at the forefront of the series, it’s no wonder fans believe that the show is improvised. Carell has a long-standing career with Improv and got his start working at Second City in Chicago. The actor is famed for his ability to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="create great characters (opens in a new tab)" href=#>create great characters</a> and think on his feet, and there were quite a few moments where he used his improvisational skills on the set of The Office.</p><h2>The Michael/Oscar Kiss</h2><p id=par-3_77>One of Carell’s most memorable improvised moments comes from the episode “Gay Witch Hunt.” In this episode, Michael discovers that his employee, Oscar, is a gay man. In an effort to prove his tolerance and acceptance he embraces Oscar in front of the entire office before kissing him on the mouth. What makes this scene so incredible is not only the level of discomfort between both characters, but also Oscar’s sheer disbelief at what is occurring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkbtqs-pBmg</p></figure><p id=par-4_51>It would seem that the disbelief wasn’t feigned at all. While the hug was a scripted moment, the kiss was something that Carell improvised on the spot. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="In an interview (opens in a new tab)" href=#>In an interview</a>, Oscar Nunez (who played Oscar Martinez on the show) reflected on what he was experiencing throughout that incredibly awkward kiss.</p><p id=par-5_84>“I was thinking, ‘I can’t believe he did it.’ And then I was thinking, right after that, ‘Of course he did it!’ And then I was thinking ‘I hope no one laughs. I hope we can use this. I hope no one laughs out loud.’ Because I know there’s a bunch of gigglers out there, and I thought, ‘I hope it’s not a ruined take that we can’t use.’ But thankfully the cameras were on us, so it worked out okay,” Nunez confessed.</p><h2>The cast improvised elements of the show</h2><p id=par-6_62>But although parts of the show were definitely enhanced with improvisation by Carell and other talented members of the cast, the show was absolutely scripted. However, the cast did have the opportunity to play a bit and put their own spin on things. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Jenna Fischer (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Jenna Fischer</a>, who played Pam, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="wrote a blog (opens in a new tab)" href=#>wrote a blog</a> which provided more clarity about how the show was run.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/the-office.jpg><h2>Jenna Fischer weighs in</h2><p id=par-7_66>“Our shows are 100 percent&nbsp;scripted. They put everything down on paper. Our glances to camera, our hesitations… everything. It is the actor’s job to make it seem fresh and natural. But we get to play around a little bit, too.&nbsp;Steve&nbsp;(Carell)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rainn&nbsp;(Wilson) are brilliant improvisers. They often come up with funny alternate jokes within a scene,” Fischer wrote at a time when the show was still recording.</p><h2>Episodes that utilize improv</h2><p id=par-8_78>Fischer continued on to give more insight into some of the ways that improv was used on the show and the impact that it had. “Some of Steve’s stuff on the streets of NYC in the “Valentine’s Day” episode was improvised. And in “Sexual Harassment,” when Dwight is asking Toby about the female body, Rainn improvised that. It makes working with them very fun. But <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the writers (opens in a new tab)" href=#>the writers</a> are great at writing dialogue that sounds real” the actress wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/the-office-reboot.jpg><h2>The Office Will Leave Netflix</h2><p id=par-9_61>So while The Office is absolutely scripted, there is a fair amount of improvisation that builds on the beauty of each script. What’s wonderful is that even though the show is scripted, it flows so naturally and organically. The Office is such a great show to watch and we’ll be bingeing it from now until Netflix takes it down in 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqJ2foZOaerSv0aKnrZ2UY7W1ucto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./salt-bae-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Salt Bae Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
