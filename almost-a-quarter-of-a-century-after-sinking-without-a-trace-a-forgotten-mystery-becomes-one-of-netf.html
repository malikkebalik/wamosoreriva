It’s not even as if it’s some sort of unsung gem, either, looking at middling Rotten Tomatoes approval ratings of 43 and 58 from critics and audiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-deep-end-of-the-ocean-1.jpg><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Michelle Pfeiffer stars as a mother plunged into a deep depression after her youngest son mysteriously vanishes without a trace, only for her to stumble across a child with a striking resemblance to her son almost a decade later. Teaming up with Whoopi Goldberg’s detective, the pair try to unravel what’s really going on, with her hopes raising increasingly that an emotional reunion could really be on the cards after all hope was long since thought lost.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>The Deep End of the Ocean couldn’t even come anywhere near to recouping its $38 million budget from theaters almost a quarter of a century ago, but it’s inexplicably emerged as a seriously heavy hitter on the market-leading streaming service in May of 2023. If anyone cares to take a guess as to why, we’d be happy to hear it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWln6jBbq2MqqyaqqSav267xWaYZpuVo8G2vthmmJ%2Bslad6tLXNpKCnn12strW0zq6rZpldqb%2Bir8RmmGaen6e0sMDTnqVmpamowaa%2B2GaZnpuforK0ec6nnGanlmK7psDFpaCxq12XtqizxKyrZqCZqcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-ashley-judd.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Ashley Judd?</span></a>
