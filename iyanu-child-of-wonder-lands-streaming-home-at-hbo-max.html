CEO of Yooneek Studios and Iyanu: Child of Wonder creator, Okupe, will be working closely with the animation, writing and directing multiple episodes. Of the recent announcement he said,</p><p>“When I set out to create ‘Iyanu’ for a global audience, I wanted to develop a world that combined everything I love about the fantasy genre with the majesty and awe that is ancient West Africa. On top of that, working with Godwin Akpan, who illustrated the books, as our art director and collaborating with a thoughtful studio-like Lion Forge Animation that prioritizes authenticity and diversity, is beyond belief.”</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a><p data-characters=750 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=true>This addition to the streaming giants’ projects signals the growing inclusion of African storytelling on the global stage. Lion Forge Animation will be financing and overseeing the project, and the head of production, two-time Emmy winner Saxton Moore, will serve as supervising director. Founder David Steward II believes that “the authenticity of the ‘Iyanu’ story means everything to us and aligns perfectly with our mission to create and deliver inclusive content to global audiences.” He continued, “a powerful means of accomplishing and sustaining this is through franchise building, and the depth and layers of the Iyanu world allow us to explore and create a beautiful universe on-screen alongside tremendous partners.”</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>If you wish to get to know the story before it is animated you can purchase the graphic novels from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqxcCnrGabmJ65pXnOn2Swp56ZsrN5y5qlnatdqMGzscCmoKefXZ28rrGMmqtmoJKkeq6t12g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-you-see-the-same-numbers-over-over-again-the-universe-might-be-trying-to-tell-you-something.html><span>←</span><span>Do You See The Same Numbers Over &amp;amp; Over Again?
