According to his mother, Lisa Wayne, he wanted to get into the wing business, as she explained the following on social media:</p><p>“He was in the process of starting a wing business, West Wings. He created the flavors to his perfection and named them after west coast rappers. Snoop Dog, Kendrick Lamar, Roddy Ricch, The Game, etc,” Wayne wrote. “He had flavors like, Tequila Lime Agave…those were my favorite. A Hennessy Maple flavor, oh man, just so damn good. I can say that my son was my favorite chef. He was on to something great and that was his passion.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gregory-boyce.jpg alt="Gregory Boyce" width=1275 height=657 sizes="(max-width: 1275px) 100vw, 1275px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>At the moment, no further details have been released in regards to Boyce’s death or what might’ve happened to him and his girlfriend, but this is certainly tragic to hear of and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false><strong>Gregory Tyree Boyce&nbsp;</strong>is survived by his 10-year-old daughter, Alaya, while Natalie Adepoju is survived by her baby son, Egypt.
