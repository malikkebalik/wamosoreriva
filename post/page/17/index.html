<a href=../../../smokey-robinson-says-michael-jackson-didn-t-create-the-moonwalk.html></a>
Michael Jackson is undeniably one of the greatest entertainers of all time. One thing that sets him apart are his electric live performances. He constantly introduced innovative sets, costumes, and of course, choreography, including the moonwalk. As it turns out, Smokey Robinson, a fellow Motown legend, says Jackson didn‚Äôt create the dance.&nbsp;
Smokey Robinson says Michael Jackson learned the moonwalk from The Nicholas Brothers Robinson first met Jackson when he auditioned at Motwoen as a child alongside his brothers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>50 Games Like StarCraft for IOS iPhone</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>

Here are some photos of Bradley Cooper yesterday in Madrid for the premiere and photocall for Silver Linings Playbook, and he‚Äôs looking basically the same as always, right? Same shifty stance, same serial killer good looks. His hair is a bit different though, and I apologize for the slightly misleading headline about Bradley admitting to perming his hair because that makes it sound like he does it all the time just for fun.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does Peter Graves Make?

The Sharma sisters are new to the ton in Bridgerton Season 2. While the Netflix series has been praised for its inclusive characters, the Sharmas are the first to be from South Asia. Being Indian and growing up away from London means Kate and Edwina had a more worldly upbringing. Bridgerton Season 2 did the job of including accurate representations of Indian culture in subtle yet profound ways.

Jordan Peele is a familiar face in writers‚Äô rooms, on movie screens, and on the red carpet. He is a man of many talents that are often publicly celebrated. Yet his off-camera life is a little more private and some wonder if there is a reason for that. While some celebrities seem to love the limelight, and happily give the world a behind-the-scenes look at their lives and loves, Jordan Peele seems to keep his private life exactly that ‚Äì private.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jason Biggs Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</h2><time>Sep 4, 2024</time>

Julianne Hough apparently has a teenaged niece named Star. I‚Äôll spare you the details of how Page Six combed through this girl‚Äôs social media accounts to find evidence of the familial connection, suffice to say that Julianne and Star are related and it does seem to be an aunt/niece relationship. Star is a TikToker and she has no respect!!! Star decided to spill some details about her auntie‚Äôs sexual history and no one involved wants this information out there.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/16/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
