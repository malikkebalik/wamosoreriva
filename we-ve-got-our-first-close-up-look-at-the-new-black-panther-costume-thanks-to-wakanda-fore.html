The frame of the suit looks very petite, tailored perhaps for Letitia Wright who plays Shuri. Another heavy clue that it is likely T’Challa’s younger genius sister is the white dotted markings on the mask that resemble the ones the princess wears in the first film as part of her ceremonial and warrior attire.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>The suit wasn’t the only costume on display with Queen Ramonda, Nakia, M’Baku, and Namor’s costumes amongst others also available for the crowds to gaze upon. The costumes and design of Wakanda are a huge part of what made Black Panther so beloved the first time around as they celebrate African culture and design. With the premiere happening right now it won’t be long till the reviews start pouring in so stay tuned!</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will pounce into theaters on Nov. 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorp6ulWK0sMCMqKyrZZaev7TAjJyjqKuVYsKxecuopqRlkal6tbTEZqWer12XuaKvymanmqaknbKzecKoqq2tnZp6tbTAp6KsZaSkeritypqlnZldm7yzsdWeqWaoopq6qrHRnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./verona-pooth-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Verona Pooth Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
