Many feel that it would’ve been more accurate to have Willow identify as bisexual and in a new interview, creator Joss Whedon agreed with this view. However, he admits that he couldn’t make it happen at the time.</p><p>“There are you things you can’t do, thanks to [the society at the time]. OK, you can’t make Willow bi, you can’t say this is a phase, because that’s what people do to deny their existence,” Whedon says. “So, if I did it now, I’d be like yes she can be bi. Because some people are! But back then it was like, no…we’re not ready for that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sarah-michelle-gellar-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-dress.jpg><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Whedon’s argument is a sound one. He’s previously spoken a lot about how he was passionate about portraying an openly gay character/relationship in the series, so in his enthusiasm to push the boundaries he had to make sure people accepted that Willow was gay. Which meant depicting her as a lesbian rather than bi, due to the perception of the LGBT community at the time, which we’re thankfully moving past now.</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=false>Whedon hypothetically mentions making it now, which is interesting, as he’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actually working on a reboot</a>. Back in 2018, it was announced that he was producing a new <strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </strong>series, with Monica Owusu-Breen serving as showrunner. It’s believed that this would be some kind of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">legacy/continuation show</a>, though we don’t know if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">any old faces will be back</a>. The project seems to have gone quiet of late, too, though it’s still in development, as far as we know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjwcWfsGaukaK9qr7EZqqlmamav27DyKWjqK9dl7a0sdeumKVlpKSxosWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-deluca-before-the-season-17-break.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to DeLuca Before the Season 17 Break?</span></a>
